    the years when taking Red Hat exams. Nothing from the actual exam will be shared,
    but only technical shortcuts and quality-of-life items that might help make your
    life easier. With what you have learned in this book so far and from studying
    the mock exam questions, I am sure you will succeed, but with a few more words
    to the wise, we can make test day less stressful. These are just some things that
    you can do to make life easier during the exam but are not necessary to pass it.
    So, without further ado, let’s get started!

    a remote exam. A remote exam allows you to use a laptop or desktop in a secure

    I am used to, so I recommend using a monitor you are comfortable with as you will
    want to maximize your space as you are only allowed one monitor. This means if

- en: First, let’s start with something that can make your life easier right from
    the start. Read all of the directions from top to bottom. The reason I say this
    is because it can save you time if it tells you something specific that can be
    omitted from repetition, such as only doing things on certain servers. It will
    also let you know how things will be graded. By reading the directions, you will
    understand your test environment better and be prepared to dive head-first into
    the material. Anywhere you can save time is a win.
  id: totrans-44
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 首先，让我们从一件可以让您从一开始就轻松应对的事情入手。请从头到尾阅读所有说明。我之所以这么说，是因为如果说明告诉您可以省略某些重复的操作，比如只在特定的服务器上执行某些任务，那么这样可以节省您的时间。它还会告诉您考试的评分标准。通过阅读说明，您将更好地理解测试环境，并做好充分准备，深入学习材料。任何可以节省时间的地方，都是一次胜利。
- en: Speaking of time, utilize the full 4 hours for the exam. Do not try and rush
    it to wrap it up sooner; you are not graded on the time it takes other than that
    4-hour window, which is all the time you are allotted for the exam. It will shut
    down your access to the exam when the timer hits 0\. Do not let a question rob
    you of time. If you are better at other items, do those first and come back to
    the tougher questions if you have the time so that you can cover the most ground.
  id: totrans-45
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 说到时间，充分利用考试的 4 小时。不要试图匆忙结束；除非是在这 4 小时的时间窗口内，您不会因为花费时间长短而受到评分限制。考试结束时，计时器归零，您将失去对考试的访问权限。不要让某个问题占用您的时间。如果您擅长其他项目，先做这些，之后再回到难度较大的问题，确保您能尽可能多地覆盖内容。
- en: Another thing to keep in mind for saving time is to do everything that is not
    specifically called out to a specific user as root. You can always restore the
    SELinux contexts with a `restorecon -Rv <directory>` that may receive the wrong
    context due to the user. By using root, you will not run into issues where you
    might forget to use the sudo command, and being the root user directly makes finding
    files a breeze as you can access the entire file structure. Just be careful, as
    this can lead to permission issues with files and folders, so if the exam tells
    you to use a specific user for an action, do so. This is not best practice in
    everyday life but can be a time saver on the exam.
  id: totrans-46
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 另一个节省时间的提示是：做所有没有明确指定给某个特定用户的任务时，请以 root 用户身份执行。您始终可以使用`restorecon -Rv <directory>`恢复可能因用户而导致错误上下文的
    SELinux 上下文。通过使用 root 用户，您将避免忘记使用 sudo 命令的问题，作为 root 用户，查找文件也变得非常轻松，因为您可以访问整个文件结构。只需小心，因为这可能会导致文件和文件夹的权限问题，因此如果考试要求您为某个操作使用特定用户，请遵循此要求。虽然在日常生活中这不是最佳实践，但在考试中可以节省时间。

    exam counts toward the five additional exams needed to receive the **Red Hat Certified
    Architect** (**RHCA**) along with the **Red Hat Certified Expert** (**RHCE**)
    exam. I hope you gained some insights into how I accomplish tasks. However, it’s
    important you know that these are not the only ways you can complete these tasks
    to accomplish your certification goals, but some of the many that will hopefully
    spur you on to the path of victory.

  zh: 最后，我们来到了这本书的旅程终点。我要感谢你们选择与我一起进入 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 的世界。我非常高兴能够写这本书，希望能帮助尽可能多的人实现成为
    **Red Hat 认证服务管理与自动化专家**（**EX358**）的目标。这场考试是获得 **Red Hat 认证架构师**（**RHCA**）资格所需的五个额外考试之一，同时也需要通过
    **Red Hat 认证专家**（**RHCE**）考试。我希望你们能从中获得一些如何完成任务的洞察。然而，重要的是你要知道，这些并不是你完成这些任务以实现认证目标的唯一方法，而是众多方法中的一些，希望它们能激励你走向胜利之路。
