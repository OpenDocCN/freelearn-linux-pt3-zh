<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">Linux is an operating system in much the same way that Windows is an operating system (and there any similarities between Linux and Windows end). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">The term operating system is used to describe the software that acts as a layer between the hardware in a computer and the applications that we all run on a daily basis. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">When programmers write applications, they interface with the operating system to perform such tasks as writing files to the hard disk drive and displaying information on the screen. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.4">Without an operating system, every programmer would have to write code to access the hardware of the system directly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.5">In addition, the programmer would have to be able to support every single piece of hardware ever created to be sure the application would work on every possible hardware configuration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.6">Because the operating system handles all of this hardware complexity, application development becomes a much easier task. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.7">Linux is just one of a number of different operating systems available today.</span></p>

<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">To understand the history of Linux, we first have to go back to AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in the late 1960s. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">During this time, AT&amp;T had discontinued involvement in developing a new operating system named Multics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">However, two AT&amp;T engineers, Ken Thompson, and Dennis Ritchie, decided to take what they had learned from the Multics project and create a new operating system named UNIX which quickly gained popularity and wide adoption both with corporations and academic institutions. </span></p>
<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">A variety of proprietary </span><a id="_idIndexMarker014"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">UNIX implementations eventually came to market, including those created by</span><a id="_idIndexMarker015"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1"> IBM (</span><a id="_idIndexMarker016"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">AIX), </span><a id="_idIndexMarker017"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">Hewlett-Packard (</span><a id="_idIndexMarker018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">HP-UX), and Sun Microsystems (</span><a id="_idIndexMarker019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">SunOS and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Solaris). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">In addition, a UNIX-like operating system named </span><a id="_idIndexMarker021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">MINIX was created by </span><a id="_idIndexMarker022"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Andrew S. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">Tanenbaum and designed for educational use with source code access provided to universities.</span></p>

<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">The origins of Linux can be traced back to the work and philosophies of two people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">At the heart of the Linux operating system is something called the </span><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">kernel</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">This is the core set of features necessary for the operating system to function. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">The </span><a id="_idIndexMarker023"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">kernel manages the system’s resources and handles communication between the hardware and the applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">The Linux kernel was developed by </span><a id="_idIndexMarker024"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Linus Torvalds, who, taking a dislike to MS-DOS and impatient for the availability of MINIX for the new Intel 80386 microprocessor, decided to write his own UNIX-like kernel. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">When he had finished the first version of the kernel, he released it under an open-source license that enabled anyone to download the source code and freely use and modify it without having to pay Linus any money.</span></p>
<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">Around the same time, </span><a id="_idIndexMarker025"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Richard Stallman at the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker026"/><a id="_idIndexMarker027"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Free Software Foundation, a strong advocate of free and open-source software, was working on an open-source operating system of his own. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Rather than focusing initially on the kernel, however, Stallman began by developing open-source versions of all the UNIX tools, utilities, and compilers necessary to use and maintain an operating system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">By the time he had finished developing this infrastructure, the obvious solution was to combine his work with the kernel Linus had written to create a complete operating system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">This combination became known as GNU/Linux. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.5">Purists insist that Linux always be referred to as </span><a id="_idIndexMarker028"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">GNU/Linux (in fact, at one time, Richard Stallman refused to give press interviews to any publication which failed to refer to Linux as GNU/Linux). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">This is not unreasonable, given that the GNU tools developed by the Free Software Foundation make up a significant and vital part of GNU/Linux. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">Unfortunately, most people and publications refer to Linux as Linux, which will probably always continue to be the case.</span></p>
