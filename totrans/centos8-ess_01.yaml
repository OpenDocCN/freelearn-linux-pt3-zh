- en: CentOS is one of a number of variants (also referred to as distributions) of
    the Linux operating system. It is based on the source code of the Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux distribution, developed by a U.S. company named Red Hat, Inc., based in
    Raleigh, North Carolina. The company was founded in the mid-1990s through the
    merger of two companies owned at the time by Marc Ewing and Bob Young. The origins
    of Linux, however, go back even further. This chapter will outline the history
    of both the Linux operating system and Red Hat, Inc. before explaining how CentOS
    fits into this picture.

  zh: CentOS 是 Linux 操作系统的众多变种之一（也称为发行版）。它基于由美国公司 Red Hat, Inc. 开发的 Red Hat 企业版 Linux
    发行版的源代码，总部位于北卡罗来纳州的罗利市。该公司成立于 1990 年代中期，由当时由 Marc Ewing 和 Bob Young 拥有的两家公司合并而成。然而，Linux
    的起源更为悠久。本章将概述 Linux 操作系统和 Red Hat, Inc. 的历史，然后解释 CentOS 如何融入这一背景。

  zh: 2.1 Linux 究竟是什么？
- en: Linux is an operating system in much the same way that Windows is an operating
    system (and there any similarities between Linux and Windows end). The term operating
    system is used to describe the software that acts as a layer between the hardware
    in a computer and the applications that we all run on a daily basis. When programmers
    write applications, they interface with the operating system to perform such tasks
    as writing files to the hard disk drive and displaying information on the screen.
    Without an operating system, every programmer would have to write code to directly
    access the hardware of the system. In addition, the programmer would have to be
    able to support every single piece of hardware ever created to be sure the application
    would work on every possible hardware configuration. Because the operating system
    handles all of this hardware complexity, application development becomes a much
    easier task. Linux is just one of a number of different operating systems available
    today.

  zh: Linux 是一种操作系统，就像 Windows 是操作系统一样（Linux 和 Windows 之间的相似之处到此为止）。操作系统这个术语用于描述充当计算机硬件和我们每天使用的应用程序之间的层的软件。当程序员编写应用程序时，他们通过操作系统接口来执行诸如将文件写入硬盘驱动器、在屏幕上显示信息等任务。如果没有操作系统，每个程序员都必须编写代码直接访问系统的硬件。此外，程序员还必须支持每一个曾经创造的硬件，以确保应用程序能够在所有可能的硬件配置上运行。由于操作系统处理了所有这些硬件复杂性，应用程序开发变得容易得多。Linux
    只是当今可用的多种操作系统之一。

- en: To understand the history of Linux, we first have to go back to AT&T Bell Laboratories
    in the late 1960s. During this time AT&T had discontinued involvement in the development
    of a new operating system named Multics. Two AT&T engineers, Ken Thompson and
    Dennis Ritchie, decided to take what they had learned from the Multics project
    and create a new operating system named UNIX which quickly gained popularity and
    wide adoption both with corporations and academic institutions.

    UNIX，并迅速在企业和学术机构中获得了广泛的认可和采用。
- en: A variety of proprietary UNIX implementations eventually came to market including
    those created by IBM (AIX), Hewlett-Packard (HP-UX) and Sun Microsystems (SunOS
    and Solaris). In addition, a UNIX-like operating system named MINIX was created
    by Andrew S. Tanenbaum designed for educational use with source code access provided

  zh: 2.3 谁创造了 Linux？
- en: The origins of Linux can be traced back to the work and philosophies of two
    people. At the heart of the Linux operating system is something called the kernel.
    This is the core set of features necessary for the operating system to function.
    The kernel manages the system’s resources and handles communication between the
    hardware and the applications. The Linux kernel was developed by Linus Torvalds
    who, taking a dislike to MS-DOS, and impatient for the availability of MINIX for
    the new Intel 80386 microprocessor, decided to write his own UNIX-like kernel.
    When he had finished the first version of the kernel, he released it under an
    open source license that enabled anyone to download the source code and freely
    use and modify it without having to pay Linus any money.

  zh: Linux 的起源可以追溯到两个人的工作和理念。Linux 操作系统的核心是所谓的内核。内核是操作系统功能所需的核心功能集合。它管理系统资源并处理硬件与应用程序之间的通信。Linux
    内核由 Linus Torvalds 开发，Linus 对 MS-DOS 不感兴趣，并且由于 Intel 80386 微处理器的 MINIX 版本迟迟未发布，他决定编写自己的类似
    UNIX 的内核。当他完成内核的第一个版本时，他将其以开源许可证发布，允许任何人下载源代码并自由使用和修改，而无需支付 Linus 任何费用。
- en: Around the same time, Richard Stallman at the Free Software Foundation, a strong
    advocate of free and open source software, was working on an open source operating
    system of his own. Rather than focusing initially on the kernel, however, Stallman
    decided to begin by developing open source versions of all the UNIX tools, utilities
    and compilers necessary to use and maintain an operating system. By the time he
    had finished developing this infrastructure it seemed like the obvious solution
    was to combine his work with the kernel Linus had written to create a full operating
    system. This combination became known as GNU/Linux. Purists insist that Linux
    always be referred to as GNU/Linux (in fact, at one time, Richard Stallman refused
    to give press interviews to any publication which failed to refer to Linux as
    GNU/Linux). This is not unreasonable given that the GNU tools developed by the
    Free Software Foundation make up a significant and vital part of GNU/Linux. Unfortunately,
    most people and publications simply refer to Linux as Linux and this will probably
    always continue to be the case.

  zh: 大约在同一时期，Free Software Foundation 的 Richard Stallman，这位强烈支持自由和开源软件的人，正在开发自己的开源操作系统。然而，Stallman
    并未一开始就专注于内核，而是决定从开发所有必要的 UNIX 工具、实用程序和编译器的开源版本开始，用于使用和维护操作系统。当他完成了这些基础设施的开发后，似乎最明显的解决方案是将他的工作与
    Linus 编写的内核结合，创建一个完整的操作系统。这个组合被称为 GNU/Linux。纯粹主义者坚持认为 Linux 应该始终被称为 GNU/Linux（事实上，一度
    Richard Stallman 拒绝接受任何没有将 Linux 称为 GNU/Linux 的媒体采访）。考虑到 GNU 工具是由 Free Software
    Foundation 开发的，且它们构成了 GNU/Linux 的重要和必要部分，这种立场并非不合理。不幸的是，大多数人和媒体仅称其为 Linux，这种情况可能会一直持续下去。

- en: Early releases of Red Hat Linux were shipped to customers on floppy disks and
    CDs (this, of course, predated the widespread availability of broadband internet
    connections). When users encountered problems with the software they were only
    able to contact Red Hat by email. In fact, Bob Young often jokes that this was
    effective in limiting support requests since, by the time a customer realized
    they needed help, their computer was usually inoperative and therefore unavailable
    to be used to send an email message seeking assistance from Red Hat’s support
    team. In later years Red Hat provided better levels of support tied to paid subscriptions
    and now provides a variety of support levels ranging from “self help” (no support)
    up to premium support.

    Hat提供了更好的支持服务，配套有付费订阅，并且现在提供了多种支持等级，从“自助帮助”（无支持）到高级支持不等。

    Red Hat. RHEL is an open source product in that you can download the source code
    free of charge and build the software yourself if you wish to do so (a task not
