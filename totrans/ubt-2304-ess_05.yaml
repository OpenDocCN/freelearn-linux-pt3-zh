- en: Ubuntu 23.04 includes the GNOME 44 desktop environment. Although lacking the
    complexity of Windows and macOS desktops, GNOME provides an uncluttered and intuitive
    desktop environment that includes all of the essential features of a windowing
    environment with the added advantage that it can be learned quickly.

- en: If an Ubuntu server configuration was installed, the GNOME desktop will not
    have been included in the packages installed on the system. On server-based systems
    without a display attached, the idea of installing a graphical desktop environment
    may seem redundant. It is worth noting, however, that remote access to the GNOME
    desktop is also possible so, even on so called headless servers (i.e. servers
    lacking a monitor, keyboard, and mouse), it may still be beneficial to install
    the GNOME desktop packages. The topic of establishing remote desktop access will
    be covered in detail in the [“Ubuntu 23.04 Remote Desktop Access with Vino”](Ubuntu_Remote_Desktop_Access.xhtml#_idTextAnchor295)
    chapter of this book.

- en: Ubuntu includes the GNOME 44 desktop environment which may either be included
    during the initial installation or installed. Unlike most other desktop environments,
    GNOME is intended to provide a clean and easy to use windowing user interface.
    Key areas of the GNOME desktop include the top bar, Activities overview, and dash.
    In addition, GNOME supports multiple workspaces keeping running applications organized
    and the screen uncluttered. A variety of configuration options is also available
    within the Settings app, including desktop background settings, audio, network
    configuration, and WiFi network selection.
