    be installed once the operating system is up and running. In addition, a domain
    name can be registered with any domain name registration service.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are running Ubuntu on a cloud instance, the IP address assigned by the
    provider will be listed in the server overview information. However, if you are
    hosting your own server and your internet service provider (ISP) has assigned
    a static IP address, you must associate your domain with that address. This is
    achieved using a name server, and all domain registration services will provide
    this service.

- en: If you do not have a static IP address (i.e., your ISP provides you with a dynamic
    address that changes frequently), you can use one of several free Dynamic DNS
    (DDNS or DynDNS for short) services to map your dynamic IP address to your domain
    name.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The web server and website created in this chapter use the HTTP protocol on
    port 80 and, as such, are considered to be insecure. The problem is that the traffic
    between the web server and the client (typically a user’s web browser) is transmitted
    in clear text. In other words, the data is unencrypted and susceptible to interception.
    While not a problem for general web browsing, this is a severe weakness when performing
    tasks such as logging into websites or transferring sensitive information such
    as identity or credit card details.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These days, websites are expected to use HTTPS, which uses either Secure Socket
    Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish secure, encrypted communication
    between a web server and a client. This security is established through the use
    of public, private, and session encryption together with certificates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To support HTTPS, a website must have a certificate issued by a trusted authority
    known as a Certificate Authority (CA). When a browser connects to a secure website,
    the web server sends back a copy of the website’s SSL certificate, which also
    contains a copy of the site’s public key. The browser then validates the authenticity
    of the certificate with trusted certificate authorities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the certificate is valid, the browser uses the public key sent by the server
    to encrypt a session key and pass it to the server. The server decrypts the session
    key using the private key to send an encrypted acknowledgment to the browser.
    Once this process is complete, the browser and server use the session key to encrypt
    all subsequent data transmissions until the session ends.
