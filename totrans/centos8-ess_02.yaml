  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are now two ways in which a CentOS 8 system can be deployed. One method
    is to either purchase new hardware or re-purpose an existing computer system on
    which to install and run the operating system. Another option is to create a cloud-based
    operating system instance using services such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud or Microsoft
    Azure (to name but a few). Since cloud-based instances are typically created by
    selecting a pre-configured, ready to run operating system image that is already
    optimized for the cloud platform, and using that as the basis for the CentOS system,
    there is no need to perform a manual operating system installation in this situation.

    disk is cleared of any existing partitions and dedicated entirely to CentOS) or
    in a dual boot environment where CentOS co-exists with another operating system
    on the disk (typically a member of the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems).

- en: The first step in working with CentOS 8 is to install the operating system.
    In the case of a cloud-based server, this task is typically performed automatically
    when an operating system image is selected for the system based on a range of
    options offered by the cloud service provider. Installation on your own hardware,
    however, involves downloading the installation media in the form of an ISO image,
    writing that image to suitable storage such as a DVD or USB drive and booting
    from it. Once running, the installation process allows a range of options to be
    configured ranging from networking, whether the installation should proceed from
    the local media or via a remote server or repository, the packages to be installed,
    and the partitioning of the disk. Once installation is complete, it is important
    to install any operating system updates that may have been released since the
    original installation image was created.
