- en: Welcome to *Hands-On Enterprise Automation on Linux*, your guide to a collection
    of the most valuable processes, methodologies, and tools for streamlining and
    efficiently managing your Linux deployments at enterprise scale. This book will
    provide you with the knowledge and skills required to standardize your Linux estate
    and manage it at scale, using open source tools including Ansible, AWX (Ansible
    Tower), Pulp, Katello, and OpenSCAP. You will learn about the creation of standard
    operating environments, and how to define, document, manage, and maintain these
    standards using Ansible. In addition, you will acquire knowledge of security hardening
    standards, such as the CIS Benchmarks. Throughout the book, practical, hands-on
    examples will be provided for you to try for yourself, on which you can build
    your own code, and to demonstrate the principles being covered.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for anyone who has a Linux environment to design, implement, and
    care for. It is intended to appeal to a wide range of open source professionals,
    from infrastructure architects through to system administrators, including professionals
    up to C level. Proficiency in the implementation and maintenance of Linux servers
    and familiarity with the concepts involved in building, patching, and maintaining
    a Linux server infrastructure are assumed. Prior knowledge of Ansible and other
    automation tools is not essential but may be beneficial.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To follow the examples in this book, it is recommended that you have access
    to at least two Linux machines for testing on, though more may be preferable to
    develop the examples more fully. These can be either physical or virtual machines—all
    examples were developed on a set of Linux virtual machines, but should work just
    as well on physical ones. In [Chapter 5](3802fb48-9f14-4a52-98c5-280d381260a4.xhtml),
    *Using Ansible to Build Virtual Machine Templates for Deployment*, we make use
    of nested virtualization on a KVM virtual machine to build a Linux image. The
    exact hardware requirements for this are listed at the beginning of this chapter.
    This will require either access to a physical machine with the appropriate CPU
    to run the examples on, or a hypervisor that supports nested virtualization (for
    example, VMware or Linux KVM).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Please be aware that some examples in this book could be disruptive to other
    services on your network; where there is such a risk, this is highlighted at the
    beginning of each chapter. I recommend you try out the examples in an isolated
    test network unless/until you are confident that they will not have any impact
    on your operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although other Linux distributions are mentioned in the book, we focus on two
    key Linux distributions—CentOS 7.6 (though if you have access to it, you are welcome
    to use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6, which should work just as well in most examples),
    and Ubuntu Server 18.04\. All test machines were built from the official ISO images,
    using the minimal installation profile.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As such, where additional software is required, we take you through the steps
    needed to install it so that you can complete the examples. If you choose to complete
    all the examples, you will install software such as AWX, Pulp, Katello, and OpenSCAP.
    The only exception to this is FreeIPA, which is mentioned in [Chapter 10](c0f8fc80-0786-4ada-a033-e14e38d989ff.xhtml),
    *Managing Users on Linux*. Installing a directory server for your enterprise is
    a huge topic that sadly requires more space than we have in this book—hence, you
    may wish to explore this topic independently.

    but Ansible can actually be run on any machine with Python 2.7 or Python 3 (versions
    3.5 and higher) installed (Windows is supported for the control machine, but only
    through a Linux distribution running in the **Windows Subsystem for Linux** (**WSL**)
    layer available on newer versions of Windows. Supported operating systems for
    Ansible include (but are not limited to) Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, macOS,
    and FreeBSD.
