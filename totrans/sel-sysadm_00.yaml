    solutions for Linux and is available by default in most major Linux distributions,
    such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, and Gentoo, as well as being
    easily enabled in others, such as SUSE, Debian, and Ubuntu.'

    of SELinux on Linux systems, ranging from understanding what SELinux is and how
    it acts to tuning SELinux controls and its integrations within Linux and application
    platforms, up to the definition and maintenance of custom policies.'

- en: This book is for Linux administrators who want to control the secure state of
    their systems. It's packed with the latest information on SELinux operations and
    administrative procedures so you'll be able to further harden your system through
    **mandatory access control** (**MAC**) – a security strategy that has been shaping
    Linux security for years.

    can be positioned to enhance the security of Linux systems and Linux-hosted services
    within their organization.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book focuses on the SELinux technology, which is enabled by default on
    many Linux distributions. While the book uses CentOS version 8 for most of its
    examples, any Linux distribution that has an SELinux implementation based upon
    the reference policy (which is the case for all major Linux distributions out
    there) suffices to follow this book.

    Communications*, one section covers using SELinux for InfiniBand infrastructure,
    which requires specialized hardware if you want to follow the examples to the
    letter. However, most of the chapter can be followed without additional requirements.
