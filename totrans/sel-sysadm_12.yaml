- en: In [*Chapter 9*](B16276_09_Final_VK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor257), *Secure Virtualization*,
    we saw that libvirt is able to apply sVirt protection measures, based upon SELinux
    domains and category assignation, to several supported hypervisors. Xen, another
    popular open source hypervisor, is also supported by libvirt, but it is much more
    common to use Xen on its own, independent from libvirt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Xen itself has a security framework called **Xen Security Modules** (**XSM**),
    similar to **Linux Security Modules** (**LSM**), and an access control system
    called XSM-FLASK, which is their SELinux-based security framework. We'll see how
    Xen uses XSM, how to build Xen with XSM support, and finally, how we can apply
    policies to Xen domains.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Xen hypervisor runs directly on top of hardware and sits in between the
    various virtual machines and the hardware itself. Unlike QEMU or KVM, which run
    as a process within Linux to offer the virtualization functionality, Xen works
    more independently. As a result, administrators will not see the running instances
    as separate processes. Instead, they need to rely on Xen commands and APIs to
    get more information and to interact with the Xen hypervisor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Important note
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with libvirt, the Xen hypervisor uses the term *domain* to point to its guests.
    As we use the term *domain* frequently in SELinux to mean the SELinux type of
    a running process, and thus also the SELinux type of a running guest, we will
    use *guest* wherever possible. However, there will be some terminology associated
    with Xen where we will have to keep the *domain* terminology in place.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Xen always has at least one virtual guest defined, called `xend`). It is through
    dom0 that administrators will create and operate virtual guests running within
    Xen. These regular guests are unprivileged, and therefore abbreviated as **domU**—**unprivileged
    domains**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When administrators boot a Xen host, they boot into Xen's *dom0* instance, through
    which they then further interact with Xen. The Linux kernel has included support
    for running both within *dom0* as well as *domU* for quite some time now (with
    complete support, including backend drivers, since Linux kernel 3.0).

    these deployments do not support XSM (which we will enable in the *Running XSM-enabled

    we want to build it from source as released by the Xen Project immediately.

    a dom0 guest. Without this support, not only will the dom0 guest not be able to
    interact with the Xen hypervisor, it will also not be able to boot the Xen hypervisor
    itself (the Xen-enabled kernel needs to bootstrap the Xen hypervisor before launching
    itself as the dom0 guest).

    running inside the guests (and thus also dom0). As the running guests are not

    only an XSM-FLASK label (if enabled). Hence, Xen cannot benefit from the sVirt

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Xen hypervisor is quite different from the QEMU and KVM hypervisors, which
    are more readily used in libvirt. SELinux support for Xen is also different than
    sVirt as the SELinux subsystem can only be active inside Xen guests, and SELinux
    does not see other guests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Xen has resolved that by implementing its own SELinux copy as XSM-FLASK and
    has integrated the appropriate support for the XSM-FLASK labels in its own tooling.
    In this chapter, we've learned how to apply our own types to Xen guests, toggle
    the XSM state, toggle XSM booleans, and even how we can build and load our own
    XSM-FLASK policy.

    administrators to further harden and secure their container runtimes. We will
    see how sVirt can be applied to container runtimes, and how the tooling deals
    with SELinux support.
