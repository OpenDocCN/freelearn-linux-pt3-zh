  zh: 在云端部署 Ubuntu
- en: Up until now, in each chapter, we’ve been working with an instance of Ubuntu
    installed on either a local virtual machine, a physical computer or server, or
    even a Raspberry Pi. We’ve learned how to deploy Ubuntu on such devices, and we’ve
    even gone as far as deploying virtual machines as well as containers. These on-premises
    devices have served us well, but the concept of cloud computing has become quite
    popular, even more so since the previous edition of this book. In this chapter,
    we’re going to take a look at running Ubuntu in the cloud. Specifically, we’ll
    deploy an Ubuntu instance on **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**), which is a very
    popular platform for cloud computing. While we won’t go into extreme detail on
    AWS (it’s an extremely large and complex platform), you’ll definitely get a feel
    for what it’s like to deploy resources in the cloud, which will be more than enough
    to get you started.

    Ubuntu，甚至还深入到虚拟机和容器的部署。这些本地设备一直为我们提供了良好的服务，但云计算的概念已经变得非常流行，尤其是自本书上一版以来。在本章中，我们将探索如何在云端运行
    Ubuntu。具体来说，我们将部署一个 Ubuntu 实例在**亚马逊云服务**（**AWS**）上，这是一种非常流行的云计算平台。虽然我们不会详细讲解 AWS（它是一个庞大而复杂的平台），但你一定会对在云端部署资源的感觉有所了解，这对你入门已足够。

    on-premises Ubuntu installations thus far. Even if we’re running Ubuntu on a virtual
    machine in our data center, it’s still considered an on-premises installation
    even when it’s not on physical hardware. In short, an on-premises installation
    is something that resides locally with us, regardless of the type of server that
    serves as the foundation.

- en: 'The first difference when it comes to cloud computing might be somewhat obvious:
    it’s the exact opposite of a resource being on-premises. With a cloud instance
    of Ubuntu, it’s someone else’s hardware that it runs on. Most of the time, we
    won’t know what kind of server a cloud instance is running on—when we subscribe
    to the services of a cloud provider and pay a fee to run a server on that platform,
    we’re able to access the operating system just like we would a virtual machine,
    with little knowledge of the underlying data center. Although utilizing a cloud
    instance will have some sort of recurring cost, we don’t need to worry about monitoring
    hardware components or replacing failed physical devices. With the cloud, that
    becomes someone else’s problem.'

  zh: 在云计算中，第一个区别可能是比较显而易见的：它正好与资源本地化的概念相反。使用云实例的Ubuntu时，实际上是在别人的硬件上运行。大多数时候，我们并不知道云实例运行在什么样的服务器上——当我们订阅云服务提供商的服务并支付费用来在该平台上运行服务器时，我们就像使用虚拟机一样访问操作系统，几乎不需要了解底层数据中心的情况。尽管使用云实例会有一些持续的费用，但我们不需要担心监控硬件组件或更换损坏的物理设备。对于云服务来说，这些问题由别人来解决。
- en: There are various cloud providers you can choose from, with **AWS**, **Google
    Cloud Platform** (**GCP**), and **Microsoft Azure** being popular choices. Those
    are three very popular platforms. Each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses,
    and even some differentiation as far as how resources on the platform are managed.
    For the most part, there’s no right or wrong choice here, it’s important to research
    each of the platforms and make the appropriate decision for you and your organization.

- en: In addition to cloud providers, there are also **Virtual Private Server** (**VPS**)
    providers. There used to be more of a distinction between a full cloud provider
    and a VPS provider – but as time goes on, the line between the two types of platforms
    is becoming increasingly thin. For the most part, VPS providers are lighter or
    “simpler” alternatives to standard cloud providers. They provide the same core
    features, such as allowing you to build virtual machines – but they don’t usually
    offer as many features as full cloud providers do. Nowadays, VPS providers are
    rolling out new features regularly and are catching up to cloud providers in terms
    of features. Examples of popular VPS providers include **DigitalOcean** and **Linode**,
    among others. In fact, even Amazon themselves have gotten into the VPS business,
    offering a VPS alternative to their own platform, called **Amazon Lightsail**.

  zh: 除了云服务提供商之外，还有**虚拟私人服务器**（**VPS**）提供商。以前，完整的云服务提供商和VPS提供商之间有较大的区别——但随着时间的推移，这两种平台之间的界限越来越模糊。大多数情况下，VPS提供商是标准云服务提供商的较轻或“简化”版。它们提供相同的核心功能，例如允许你构建虚拟机——但通常不像完整的云服务提供商那样提供那么多功能。如今，VPS提供商正在定期推出新功能，并在功能方面赶上了云服务提供商。流行的VPS提供商包括**DigitalOcean**和**Linode**等。实际上，连亚马逊自己也进入了VPS业务，提供一种名为**Amazon
    Lightsail**的VPS替代方案。
- en: For your organization, which should you choose between a full cloud provider
    and VPS provider? Many administrators would answer this question without hesitation
    and recommend a full cloud provider. I can certainly see their point – why go
    with a “lighter” platform when you can use a solution that has all the bells and
    whistles? However, based on my experience with many organizations, I wouldn’t
    recommend going with a full cloud provider without first finding out if a VPS
    provider has all the features you need. The reason for this is that one of the
    trade-offs of having more features is that complexity increases. With an increase
    in complexity comes a larger responsibility to manage resources on that platform.
    And that complexity can create a very large administration overhead. For that
    reason, I don’t recommend full cloud providers like AWS or Azure to small organizations
    with limited IT staff. For those organizations, VPS providers would be best as
    the burden of administration is lower. Larger organizations with a team of administrators
    should have no problem tackling something like AWS.

  zh: 对于你的组织，你应该在完全云提供商和VPS提供商之间选择哪一个？许多管理员会毫不犹豫地回答这个问题，并推荐使用完全云提供商。我当然能理解他们的观点——为什么要选择一个“轻量级”平台，而可以使用一个具备所有功能的解决方案呢？然而，根据我与许多组织的经验，我不建议在没有首先确认VPS提供商是否拥有你所需要的所有功能的情况下选择完全云提供商。原因在于，拥有更多功能的权衡之一就是复杂性增加。复杂性的增加意味着你需要承担更多的责任来管理该平台上的资源。而这种复杂性可能会带来非常大的管理开销。因此，我不建议像AWS或Azure这样的完全云提供商给IT人员有限的小型组织。对于这些组织，VPS提供商是最合适的选择，因为管理负担较小。对于有一支管理员团队的大型组织来说，处理像AWS这样的服务不成问题。

    trend that they may make the mistake of trying to use such a service even when
    it doesn’t make sense to do so. Above all, as an administrator, it’s important
    to utilize the best tool available for whatever it is that you wish to accomplish,
    instead of using a technology just because you’re excited about it. Cloud computing
    is awesome for sure, but for some use cases, it’s just not a good fit. This is
    similar to containers as well: containerization is an exciting technology but
    some applications just don’t run well on that platform. It takes trial and error.'

  zh: 在选择注册某个提供商之前，首先要确保创建云资源对你或你的组织来说是一个好主意。IT专业人员常常会对新兴趋势感到兴奋，以至于可能会犯错，尝试使用这样的服务，即使这样做并不合适。最重要的是，作为一名管理员，应该利用最合适的工具来完成你想做的事情，而不是仅仅因为对某项技术感到兴奋就去使用它。云计算无疑是很棒的，但对于某些使用场景来说，它并不合适。这与容器化类似：容器化是一项令人兴奋的技术，但某些应用程序在这个平台上运行并不好。它需要经过反复试验。
- en: There are some considerable benefits when it comes to cloud computing. When
    it comes to physical servers, the hardware will fail eventually. It’s not a matter
    of “if” but “when.” All hardware *will* fail eventually. And even if you have
    hardware that doesn’t end up failing in the short term and lasts for a long time,
    it will be made obsolete by more powerful hardware that is more efficient. When
    it comes to managing physical servers, you’ll need to replace the hardware eventually.

  zh: 云计算有一些显著的好处。就物理服务器而言，硬件最终会出现故障。这不是“是否”会发生的问题，而是“何时”发生的问题。所有硬件*最终都会*故障。即使你拥有的硬件短期内没有发生故障，并且能够持续很长时间，它也会被更强大、更高效的硬件所淘汰。管理物理服务器时，最终需要更换硬件。
- en: This is also true when it comes to cloud computing; the hardware such services
    run on will need to be replaced whenever it fails or becomes obsolete (whichever
    happens first). The difference is that when that happens, the liability on you
    (the administrator) is greatly reduced. You won’t have to order a new server,
    replace parts, or even pay attention to the hardware at all. It’s solely the responsibility
    of the cloud service or VPS provider to keep track of that. A virtual machine
    you run on a cloud platform could be running on a physical server that’s a couple
    of years old, and then tomorrow be moved to a brand-new piece of hardware. And
    you might not even be aware that it was ever moved.
  id: totrans-26

  zh: 这对于云计算也是适用的；这些服务运行的硬件在发生故障或变得过时时（无论哪种情况先发生）都需要被替换。不同之处在于，当这种情况发生时，你（作为管理员）的责任大大减少。你无需再订购新服务器，替换零部件，甚至无需关注硬件。保持硬件运行的责任完全由云服务或VPS提供商承担。你在云平台上运行的虚拟机可能运行在一台已经使用了几年时间的物理服务器上，第二天可能会被迁移到一台全新的硬件上。你甚至可能没有意识到它曾经被迁移过。
- en: The trade-off, though, is potentially the cost. The reason why I mention cost
    as a “potential” trade-off is that whether or not it’s cheaper for your organization
    to purchase physical servers or pay a monthly fee for servers in the cloud comes
    down to which offers a better **Return on Investment** (**ROI**). To better understand
    this, consider an organization that utilizes only on-premises hardware for their
    data center with no cloud resources being used at all. Let’s also assume that
    every 3 years or so, they have to replace some of the more critical servers with
    newer hardware; and every 5-10 years the less-important servers are replaced.
    There’s also a need to pay for full-time administrators with specialties in managing
    physical hardware, as well as maintaining a cooling system and making sure a room
    is available to designate as a data center. Also, consider the electric bill for
    running your own data center. Add all of this up—how much is it costing the organization
    on average?

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然而，权衡的关键可能在于成本。我之所以将成本作为一个“潜在”的权衡因素提到，是因为你是否选择购买物理服务器还是支付每月的云服务器费用，最终取决于哪个方案能带来更好的**投资回报率**（**ROI**）。为了更好地理解这一点，可以考虑一个只使用本地硬件的数据中心的组织，完全不使用云资源。假设每3年左右，他们必须用更先进的硬件替换一些关键的服务器；而每5-10年，替换不太重要的服务器。还需要支付全职管理员的薪资，这些管理员需要具备管理物理硬件的专长，并维护冷却系统，确保有房间可作为数据中心使用。同时，还需要考虑自己运行数据中心的电费。将这些费用加总起来——这些开销平均会给组织带来多大成本？
- en: With physical infrastructure, you’re paying an up-front cost to purchase servers
    every time you need to do so. With cloud computing, you never have to purchase
    physical server hardware, but instead you’re paying a fee each and every month
    for the privilege of utilizing cloud infrastructure. When you add up the monthly
    costs for cloud resources, how much would that cost the organization? Would it
    cost more than running physical hardware or less?

  zh: 对于物理基础设施来说，每次需要服务器时，你都需要支付一次性的费用来购买服务器。而云计算则不需要你购买物理服务器硬件，而是每个月支付费用，以便能够使用云基础设施。当你把云资源的月度费用加起来时，这样的开销会对组织造成多大负担？它的成本会比运行物理硬件高还是低？
- en: Often, whether or not running a server in the cloud results in cost savings
    (or ends up being cost prohibitive) comes down to what types of services you wish
    to use on that platform. Running more virtual machines in the cloud is generally
    fairly inexpensive, and might often result in cost savings when compared to running
    physical infrastructure of your own. However, an example of something that might
    end up being cost prohibitive in the cloud is storage.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 通常，是否在云中运行服务器能节省成本（或最终变得过于昂贵）取决于你希望在该平台上使用的服务类型。在云中运行更多虚拟机通常是相对便宜的，并且与运行自己的物理基础设施相比，可能会带来成本节省。然而，云中可能会变得过于昂贵的一个例子就是存储。
- en: If your organization doesn’t store much data, then storage costs won’t really
    be a concern. Many companies are perfectly satisfied with employees utilizing
    something like Google Drive for shared storage and won’t even need cloud storage
    at all. Some organizations, especially those that develop software, have *massive*
    storage needs. For these companies, there could be tens or even hundreds of terabytes
    of data being stored, as well as the bandwidth costs for the data going in and
    out of the company. If you were to attempt to migrate such a large amount of data
    to a cloud server provider, you wouldn’t have to manage the storage hardware anymore,
    but your costs for cloud storage would go up dramatically and might easily be
    much more expensive than it costs you to continue to use physical hardware. Personally,
    I’ve seen storage costs result in tens of thousands of dollars extra in monthly
    billing.

  zh: 如果你的组织存储的数据量不大，那么存储成本就不会是个问题。许多公司完全满意让员工使用Google Drive之类的共享存储，甚至根本不需要云存储。一些组织，尤其是软件开发公司，*拥有庞大的*存储需求。对于这些公司来说，可能需要存储数十甚至数百TB的数据，以及数据进出公司的带宽费用。如果你试图将这么大量的数据迁移到云服务提供商那里，你不再需要管理存储硬件，但云存储的费用将大幅增加，可能比继续使用物理硬件的成本还要贵得多。我个人曾看到过存储成本每月额外增加数万美元。
- en: Another consideration is stability. It’s often argued that utilizing a cloud
    provider will result in a more stable infrastructure. That mindset seems to make
    sense at first, considering that by using a cloud provider you’re no longer responsible
    for managing the hardware. There’s definitely some truth to the claim that cloud
    resources are more stable, but it’s not quite that simple. Cloud providers *do*
    experience downtime, and it happens more often than you’d think.

  zh: 另一个需要考虑的因素是稳定性。人们常常认为，使用云服务提供商可以实现更稳定的基础设施。这个观点一开始似乎有道理，因为使用云服务提供商意味着你不再需要管理硬件。云资源更稳定这一说法确实有一定的道理，但事情并不那么简单。云服务提供商*确实*会经历停机，而且这种情况发生的频率比你想象的还要高。
- en: Cloud providers will often advertise a high level of uptime, often measured
    in “9s.” For example, AWS offers a general uptime of 99.999%, as of the date this
    book is being prepared for publishing. That sounds great, doesn’t it? Before you
    get too excited about a cloud provider’s uptime claim, it’s important to also
    know what exactly they count as part of that uptime. If an upstream provider,
    such as a backend internet resource, goes down and service is completely unavailable,
    they may not count that and continue to claim the same amount of uptime. Massive
    outages of cloud providers are not uncommon; in 2017, Amazon’s S3 service suffered
    a major outage due to one of their engineers mistyping a command. In that situation,
    many services on the internet were unavailable to customers. So while it is true
    that a cloud service provider is less likely to suffer an outage than you are
    to witness hardware failures, it’s important to keep in mind that outages are
    still possible. We can’t ever assume any service (our own or otherwise) is bulletproof.

  zh: 云服务提供商通常会宣传较高的正常运行时间，通常用“9”来衡量。例如，截至本书出版准备时，AWS提供99.999%的正常运行时间。这听起来很棒，不是吗？在你对云服务提供商的正常运行时间声明感到兴奋之前，了解他们究竟是如何计算这一正常运行时间的也很重要。如果上游提供商（如后端互联网资源）发生故障，服务完全不可用，他们可能不会把这一情况计入停机时间，依然声称保持同样的正常运行时间。云服务提供商的大规模故障并不罕见；例如，2017年亚马逊的S3服务由于一名工程师输入命令错误而发生了重大故障，导致许多互联网上的服务无法提供给用户。因此，虽然云服务提供商的故障发生率通常低于硬件故障的发生率，但仍需记住，停机会时有发生。我们永远不能假设任何服务（无论是我们的还是其他的）是万无一失的。
- en: Automation is a very important consideration with the cloud. If your resources
    encounter an issue, it’s a really good idea to have an automated means of re-deploying
    your important services. On a physical server, you can set it up exactly as you
    want it and take an image of the hard drive in case the server fails. Cloud providers
    offer you essentially the same service, giving you the ability to create images
    of your important servers so you can redeploy them in the future should you need
    to do so.

  zh: 自动化是云计算中的一个重要考虑因素。如果你的资源遇到问题，最好有一种自动化的方式来重新部署你的关键服务。在物理服务器上，你可以按需求设置服务器并将硬盘镜像保存，以防服务器发生故障。云服务提供商基本上也为你提供相同的服务，允许你创建重要服务器的镜像，以便将来需要时重新部署。
- en: If you do go with a cloud provider, make sure you keep regular backups as well
    as images. And be sure to keep a copy of at least the most recent backups locally
    outside of the cloud provider, because if the cloud provider itself goes down
    then you also lose the backup. I can probably better summarize this by advising
    you to not become over-confident in the stability of your cloud provider. Always
    assume your infrastructure will fail eventually, regardless of where it’s located

- en: The warnings I have given around the stability of cloud providers are not intended
    to scare you away from using them, but instead to steer you toward maintaining
    good hygiene with the cloud, just as you would with physical infrastructure. Basically,
    to be successful when it comes to managing servers, you’ll have to assume that
    cloud providers can fail just as easily as on-premises equipment, and make sure
    you’re well prepared if there is ever an issue. Cloud providers actually provide
    you with all the tools you need in order to build a stable infrastructure that’s
    easily reproducible and recoverable. If you utilize those tools effectively, you
    shouldn’t have anything to worry about. We’ll explore these concepts further as

  zh: 如前所述，AWS 是多个竞争的云服务提供商之一。在本章中选择 AWS，是因为与其他任何提供商相比，这个平台要求管理员在管理基础设施时采取完全不同的心态。这种不同的心态即使在
    AWS 之外也是健康的，因此它在我们旅程的这个阶段代表了一个合理的进化。
- en: Up until now, we’ve discussed server installations as essentially pets, meaning
    we want to keep them around, make sure they’re healthy, and if something goes
    wrong, try to fix it. We want to keep our servers operational for as long as possible.
    We want to be able to rely on them, and that helps our organization - customers
    and clients appreciate using a website or service that is stable, with minimal
    or no downtime.

  zh: 到目前为止，我们一直将服务器的安装看作是宠物，意味着我们希望它们一直存在，确保它们健康，如果出了问题，我们会尽力修复。我们希望尽可能长时间地保持服务器的正常运行。我们希望能够依赖它们，这有助于我们的组织——客户和用户更愿意使用一个稳定、最小化或没有停机时间的网站或服务。
- en: That last part, minimal downtime, doesn’t change regardless of the mindset we
    use when managing our infrastructure. Downtime and service disruption is bad in
    this industry, and that’s always going to be the case. The difference is what
    we do about it, and how we go about recovering from it. In fact, we can even try
    our best to automatically recover when we have a problem. If the customer never
    notices there was ever an issue, even better.

  zh: 最后一点，最小化停机时间，无论我们以什么样的心态管理基础设施，这一点都不会改变。在这个行业中，停机和服务中断是非常不好的，这一点始终不变。不同之处在于我们如何处理这个问题，以及我们如何去恢复。事实上，我们甚至可以尽最大努力在出现问题时自动恢复。如果客户从未注意到曾经发生过问题，那就更好了。
- en: With AWS, the mindset is different – we consider our servers as disposable,
    not as pets. This may seem a bit surprising at first, but if we effectively use
    the tools we’re provided, we can build an infrastructure that is scalable. This
    concept in particular is known as **Auto Scaling** and is a very important aspect
    of AWS. With Auto Scaling, resources are automatically created and destroyed as
    demand increases and decreases. For example, let’s say that your web server receives
    more visitors than normal, and its CPU is starting to max out. Auto Scaling would
    then bring up a new web server automatically, and with a load balancer, route
    clients between instances as needed to spread the load. You can set the maximum
    number of instances that can be brought online, and then when the load decreases,
    the servers that were brought online to handle the load will automatically get
    deleted. This means that you can architect your cloud solution such that you’ll
    have the exact number of servers in existence as you need at any given time.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 使用 AWS 时，心态是不同的——我们将服务器视为一次性使用品，而非宠物。这一观点一开始可能让人感到有些意外，但如果我们有效地利用所提供的工具，就可以构建一个可扩展的基础设施。这个概念特别被称为**自动扩展**，是
    AWS 的一个非常重要的方面。通过自动扩展，资源会根据需求的增加和减少自动创建和销毁。例如，假设你的网页服务器接收到的访问量比平常多，且其 CPU 已经接近最大负载。此时，自动扩展会自动启动一个新的网页服务器，并通过负载均衡器将客户端按需分配到不同的实例，从而分担负载。你可以设置可以启动的最大实例数量，然后当负载减少时，之前为应对负载而启动的服务器会自动被删除。这意味着你可以设计你的云解决方案，使得在任何时刻都能拥有恰好所需数量的服务器。
- en: 'Another level above Auto Scaling is **Auto healing**. Just as the name implies,
    auto healing means that if your server runs into a problem, it will automatically
    be “healed,” and in the case of cloud computing, this means the instance will
    be disposed of and recreated from a known good image or template. This is the
    ultimate goal of AWS (or pretty much any implementation): to have infrastructure
    that is not only scalable but also able to recover by itself. For example, perhaps
    you have a pair of web servers that handle requests from clients. One of them
    encounters some sort of issue and fails some sort of test that would imply that
    the server is unreliable. Such a test is known as a **health check**. With auto
    healing, a server that fails health checks is considered unhealthy and is deleted.
    With Auto Scaling, you also set a minimum number of servers for your application.
    If the number of servers falls below the minimum, then a new one is created to
    replace it. Depending on how you architect your solution, the customer may notice
    some degradation if the application is running on fewer servers, but that’s only
    temporary. Everything will return back to normal when the new server comes online.'

  zh: 自动伸缩之上的另一个层级是**自动修复**。顾名思义，自动修复意味着，如果你的服务器出现问题，它会自动“修复”。在云计算中，这意味着实例将被销毁并从已知的良好镜像或模板中重新创建。这是
    AWS（或者几乎所有类似实现）的终极目标：拥有不仅可扩展，而且能够自我恢复的基础设施。例如，也许你有一对处理客户端请求的 Web 服务器。其中一台遇到问题并未通过某种测试，测试表明该服务器不可靠。这样的测试被称为**健康检查**。通过自动修复，未通过健康检查的服务器会被认为是不健康的并被删除。借助自动伸缩，你还可以为你的应用设置最小服务器数量。如果服务器数量低于最低要求，则会创建一台新服务器来替代它。根据你的架构设计，客户可能会注意到应用在少数服务器上运行时的性能下降，但这只是暂时的。当新服务器上线时，一切会恢复正常。
- en: With AWS, Auto Scaling and auto healing are extremely important. I’ve seen many
    administrators make the mistake of not utilizing those features of the platform,
    and that should never be the case. Without such high-availability features, you
    risk having your server go away at any moment. This may be a bigger problem than
    you think. AWS consists of physical servers all over the world, and just like
    any other physical server, hardware failures are not only possible but happen
    regularly. If your application is running on a physical host within an AWS data
    center that encounters a hardware failure, your server may get deleted when they
    go and replace it. With Auto Scaling, this isn’t a problem. A new virtual server
    will be brought online to replace the one that was removed.

  zh: 在 AWS 中，自动伸缩和自动修复是非常重要的。我曾见过许多管理员没有利用平台的这些功能，这绝不应该发生。如果没有这些高可用性功能，你的服务器随时可能会停止运行。这可能比你想象的更严重。AWS
    的物理服务器遍布全球，和其他物理服务器一样，硬件故障不仅是可能的，而且经常发生。如果你的应用运行在 AWS 数据中心的某台物理主机上，而该主机发生硬件故障，在更换硬件时，可能会导致你的服务器被删除。使用自动伸缩，这就不是问题了。一台新的虚拟服务器将上线，替代被移除的服务器。

    exist on other cloud platforms as well. The main difference between competing
    cloud providers is the marketing terms they use for these features, but you can
    set up similar infrastructure on each. With AWS, they really focus on this aspect
    though, so it’s important to learn. But even if you’re not utilizing AWS in production
    at your organization, the concepts around being able to easily recover from disasters
    are still important and can still be implemented. If nothing else, you should

    only to AWS. But don’t let the number of services overwhelm you; you’ll only need

    EBS provides block storage, essentially the same type of storage we’ve been working
    with all along. So in a nutshell, an EBS volume is a hard disk. When you create

    or physical) that you add to your server, format, and mount. While you can still
    mount S3 on your server, it doesn’t have a filesystem (such as ext4 or STON),
    nor does it understand permissions. It’s simply a name-object pair, where you
    store files, and they have a name. With S3, you create “buckets,” and each bucket
    can have files stored inside. Each bucket name must be unique. S3 is very useful
    if you want to make downloadable files available to your clients or store backup
    files.

- en: There’s nothing wrong with using OpenSSH; with the right settings it can be
    a very secure option. In fact, we will explore methods of better securing it in
    *Chapter 21*, *Securing Your Server*. With AWS, we can use Session Manager as
    an alternative to OpenSSH, and it’s a worthwhile alternative to learn that offers
    additional security in that its backend security is not something we have to manage
    ourselves. In addition, we can control access to it through the AWS console as
    well.

  zh: 使用 OpenSSH 是没有问题的；在正确的设置下，它可以是一个非常安全的选择。实际上，我们将在 *第 21 章*，*保护你的服务器* 中探索更好地保护它的方法。对于
    AWS，我们可以使用会话管理器作为 OpenSSH 的替代方案，这个值得学习的替代方案提供了额外的安全性，因为其后台安全性不需要我们自己管理。此外，我们还可以通过
    AWS 控制台控制对它的访问。
- en: By default, Session Manager is not accessible at all. It requires a specific
    package to be installed within Ubuntu Server for it to work, and it also requires
    specific permissions to be enabled. The required package for Ubuntu is preinstalled
    by default, so the first requirement will be automatically taken care of for us
    immediately when we create our instance.

  zh: 默认情况下，会话管理器是完全无法访问的。它需要在 Ubuntu 服务器中安装特定的包才能工作，并且还需要启用特定的权限。Ubuntu 的所需软件包默认已预安装，因此第一个要求在我们创建实例时会立即自动处理。
- en: For the second requirement of adding permissions, we’ll need to create an IAM
    role to allow the EC2 instance we’re about to create to communicate with the Session
    Manager service. When I mentioned earlier that Session Manager isn’t accessible
    by default, this is why—it’s missing the permissions needed until we add them.
    To add the required permissions, we’ll access the IAM service within the AWS console,
    the very same one that we used earlier to create a user account for ourselves.
    IAM itself has many tricks up its sleeves, more than just simply allowing us to
    create users. It also allows us to create **IAM roles**, which give us the ability
    to add permissions to entire objects. For example, we can create a role with the
    permissions that are required, and then we can attach that role to any EC2 instance
    to immediately give it the ability to be connected to by Session Manager.

  zh: 对于添加权限的第二个要求，我们需要创建一个 IAM 角色，以便我们即将创建的 EC2 实例能够与会话管理器服务进行通信。我之前提到过会话管理器默认是无法访问的，这就是原因——它缺少所需的权限，直到我们添加它们。为了添加所需的权限，我们将访问
    AWS 控制台中的 IAM 服务，这与我们之前创建用户帐户时使用的相同。IAM 本身有许多技巧，不仅仅是允许我们创建用户。它还允许我们创建 **IAM 角色**，这使我们能够为整个对象添加权限。例如，我们可以创建一个具有所需权限的角色，然后将该角色附加到任何
    EC2 实例上，以立即使其能够通过会话管理器进行连接。

    type, which means the speed fluctuates based on usage. It’s able to burst to take
    care of busy workloads, but its ability to do so depends on CPU credits that it
    earns in a particular time. A full explanation is beyond the scope of this chapter,

    from. The default option, `0.0.0.0/0`, allows connections from anywhere (and is
    even labeled as such). As we’ll discuss in *Chapter 21*, *Securing Your Server*,
    allowing SSH connections publicly is a bad idea, since outside threat actors might
    try to use that as a means to access the server. With the instance we’re creating
    right now, we can make a case for allowing connections from anywhere, since it’s
    a test instance for the purposes of learning (and we’ll be deleting the instance
    before the close of the chapter). However, it might be a better idea to get into
    the habit of restricting access to OpenSSH to specific IP addresses. To do that,
    you can choose the option **My IP** from the dropdown, which will restrict access
    to OpenSSH to your public IP address.

    for the instance to include your new IP address, but that inconvenience is a small
    price to pay for added security benefit.

    `80` and `443` from the public `internet`. The reason for this is, OpenSSH gives
    you access to manage the server, so we definitely wouldn’t want that open to the
    public. When it comes to a website, we’ll most likely want the general public
    to be able to access it, which is why we allow those options. You should only
    check the latter two boxes in the situation where you’re actually planning on

    can be used to create images of the instance’s hard disk. An image can be used
    to create copies of the original server, as well as acting as a starting point
    so if the server needs to be rebuilt, we won’t have to start over from scratch.
    In AWS, images are known as **Amazon Machine Images** (**AMIs**). For all intents
    and purposes, there’s nothing very unique about AMIs; if you’ve worked with disk
    images in the past, it’s the same thing. When it comes to what to include in an
    AMI, you can (and should) use your imagination here—anything you find yourself
    manually setting up or configuring while rolling out a new server is a candidate
    to be included in an image, and the more customizations you include inside the
    image, the more time it will save you later.
  id: totrans-228
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s see this in action and create an image of the server we’ve just set up.
    We should consider shutting down our server first, although this isn’t required.
    Taking an AMI of a server that is shut down is preferred over doing the same on
    a server that is running. When the server is shut down, nothing is writing to
    its disk, so we don’t have to worry about corruption if we’re capturing an AMI
    in the middle of a critical write operation. The likelihood of running into an
    issue while creating an AMI of a running server is very small, but I recommend
    shutting down the server if you can just to be on the safe side.

    sometimes what the demand will be on that server. In the case of a popular news
    site, some articles may be more popular than others, and if something goes viral
    online, then requests to our site can increase by orders of magnitude in a short
    period of time. In the past, keeping up with customer demand was a very tedious
    process, one that may result in having to purchase an entirely new server with
    more powerful hardware. With our instance being in the cloud, we have more flexibility
    and can automate the process of bringing more servers online. And that’s exactly
    what we’re going to work on in this section.

    in AWS; we only have a simple test server that’s currently running Apache. We
    can simulate things to a point, but **Auto Scaling** is one of those things that
    requires a bit of practice to fully utilize. We will definitely get a working
    example here, though.

    the higher the potential cost. We’ll explore how to keep costs down in the next
    section, but as a general rule of thumb, delete whatever you’re not using. As
    you’ve gone through examples in this chapter, we’ve set up our own EC2 instance.
    This is great: we were able to practice some concepts around AWS and put that
    to use. But if we leave something running that we don’t need, we can have a surprise
    bill. It’s a good idea to write yourself a reminder to delete everything in your
    test AWS account when we’re done with the chapter, so you won’t have to worry

    to manually replace the server ourselves. If we set the desired instances to a
    number higher than 1, a user will not notice anything if one of the servers goes
    down, the other will take care of the load while the new one comes up. These are
    amazing benefits to be able to take advantage of and will give us additional peace
    of mind right away. To test this yourself, feel free to delete the running EC2
    instance by right-clicking it and then clicking **Terminate**. The instance should

    the application that’s running on our instance(s), which in this case is Apache
    (we had Apache installed when we built our AMI, so every instance will automatically
    have Apache set up). Normally, we can access the application by navigating to
    the public IP address of the instance. We can still do this, actually – and the
    same is true for other instances within our load balancer setup as well. But in
    order to benefit from the overall solution we’ve built, we should instead access
    the application from the **DNS name** of the load balancer. This will ensure that
    our request is routed through the load balancer, rather than directly to a specific
    server. If you navigate to the **Load balancers** section of the management console,
    you should see the DNS name there. Going forward, the application or services

    in order to build a load-balanced solution in AWS. As we grow our AWS infrastructure
    and implement more solutions, we should also keep an eye on our bill. Although
    we can utilize the free tier for now, production applications will likely need
    more powerful instances than what the free tier will provide, and the free tier
    itself won’t last forever. Not only that, but we should also know how to check
    how our bill is trending to make sure we don’t accidentally implement something
    that is expensive or waste money by running something we no longer need.

    and I’m only using instances in the free tier, I have no costs currently. But
    if I did incur charges, I’d see the current balance on the main page of the dashboard.

    sent to the primary email account.

    totals. To effectively manage billing, you should check this dashboard manually,
    which might enable you to catch an error before the end of the month, which might
    save you money. The links on the left will give you additional billing information,
    as well as providing a way of accessing previous bills.

    the things you can do in order to help keep your AWS bill down.
  id: totrans-317
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the previous section, I recommended that you check the bill regularly instead
    of only when the monthly invoice arrives. While that is good advice (if I do say
    so myself), the reality is that server administrators like us are busy and may
    not remember to check the bill on a regular basis. This is why we typically set
    up system alerts to notify us when our servers are encountering an issue. Similarly,
    we can actually set up an alert inside our AWS account that can notify us if our
    bill gets too high. In fact, even though the AWS account we’ve been working with
    was likely only created as a test account, it’s especially important that we add
    a billing alert so we can be alerted if any of our experiments were misconfigured
    in such a way that we’re incurring costs we didn’t intend to.
  id: totrans-318
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the *Further reading* section at the end of the chapter, I have included
    a link to AWS documentation that details how to set up billing alerts, and I definitely
    recommend you enable them. If you’re using an AWS account for your organization
    to run actual production servers, it’s a good idea to enable billing alerts there
    as well. In fact, be sure to create billing alerts in every AWS account you manage.
    Another important element to consider is removing backups that aren’t needed anymore,
    which can also lower costs.

- en: This may seem like a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised—every organization I’ve
    ever worked for or consulted with in regard to AWS has run into an issue where
    backups get out of control and generate large costs. My personal record for witnessing
    a waste of money in this manner is one company that had over 23,000 unnecessary
    snapshots in their account, sitting around for over 5 years. I don’t remember
    the exact dollar amount, but this error cost them thousands of dollars a month
    for years!
  id: totrans-321
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Backups themselves are extremely important though, and the previous example
    might’ve been understandable if the organization had legal requirements that forced
    them to retain all backups for a specific period (such as 5 years). And backups,
    as you well know by now, are essential if the organization runs into some sort
    of issue and needs to restore something from the past. But the general rule of
    thumb here is to ensure that when the day comes to add an automatic backup feature,
    you also implement (and regularly test) an automatic cleanup procedure as well.

- en: Many organizations do business around the clock and all year round, while others
    conduct business only during daytime business hours. While it might not be immediately
    apparent why this matters, consider the fact that you don’t get charged for an
    EC2 instance while it’s powered off. You do get charged for things like storage
    regardless of its state, but you aren’t charged for the instance itself if it
    is not running. If your organization has a server that is only used during certain
    hours, consider stopping the instance outside of that time period and then starting
    it back up when it’s needed.
  id: totrans-324
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s additional functionality in AWS that allows you to automatically schedule
    an instance to run only during certain hours, so there are ways to ensure your
    infrastructure is available when it’s needed. Make sure you keep this in mind
    as you navigate AWS; if you’re creating a new server, is it going to be necessary
    to make it run 24/7, or is it only necessary to run it at certain times? You’d
    be surprised how much money this may save you.

  id: totrans-326

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to the advice in the previous section about having instances run only
    when necessary, consider deleting instances completely if they’re not needed at
    all. Unless you’re utilizing a very specific type of instance, you won’t be billed
    for an EC2 instance that doesn’t exist. Make a habit of deleting things when you’re
    done with them. If you think you may need a server again in the future but you’re
    not sure, consider creating an AMI of the server, and then removing it. Although
    the AMI itself will have a cost, it’s going to be less than running an actual
    server.
  id: totrans-327
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This advice isn’t exclusive to EC2 instances; other services within AWS will
    also cause you to incur costs if you don’t clean them up. Make sure to keep an
    eye on other components and services that charge by usage, such as RDS, S3, EBS
    volumes, and so on.
  id: totrans-328

- en: So, there you have it—with some basic advice, you should be able to keep your
    billing under control. And even if you make a mistake, as long as you’ve configured
    billing alerts, you should be notified and be able to correct the problem quickly.
    I can understand if some of the billing advice was overwhelming, but you’ll get
    used to it. AWS has a lot of components that can make up a bill, but as long as
    you set up alerts and delete items you’re not using, you shouldn’t have any problems.
