  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A firewall is a vital component in protecting a computer system or network of
    computers from external attack (typically from an external source via an internet
    connection). Any computer connected directly to an internet connection must run
    a firewall to protect against malicious activity. Similarly, any internal network
    must have some form of firewall between it and an external internet connection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All Linux distributions are provided with a firewall solution of some form.
    In the case of CentOS 8 this takes the form of a service named firewalld.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the subject of firewall configuration can be complex, fortunately CentOS
    8 provides command-line, web-based and graphical tools that ease the firewall
    configuration process. This chapter will introduce the basic concepts of firewalld
    and cover the steps necessary to configure a firewall using the tools provided
    with the operating system.

- en: 13.1 An Introduction to firewalld
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The firewalld service uses a set a rules to control incoming network traffic
    and define which traffic is to be blocked and which is to be allowed to pass through
    to the system and is built on top of a more complex firewall tool named iptables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The firewalld system provides a flexible way to manage incoming traffic. The
    firewall could, for example, be configured to block traffic arriving from a specific
    external IP address, or to prevent all traffic arriving on a particular TCP/IP
    port. Rules may also be defined to forward incoming traffic to different systems
    or to act as an internet gateway to protect other computers on a network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In keeping with common security practices, a default firewalld installation
    is configured to block all access with the exception of SSH remote login and the
    DHCP service used by the system to obtain a dynamic IP address (both of which
    are essential if the system administrator is to be able to gain access to the
    system after completing the installation).

    zone is a preconfigured set of rules which can be applied to the system at any
    time to quickly implement firewall configurations for specific scenarios. The
    block zone, for example, blocks all incoming traffic, while the home zone imposes
    less strict rules on the assumption that the system is running in a safer environment
    where a greater level of trust is expected. New zones may be added to the system,
    and existing zones modified to add or remove rules. Zones may also be deleted
    entirely from the system. [Table 13-1](../Text/Firewall_Configuration.xhtml#_idTextAnchor161)

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any CentOS 8 system connected to the internet or a network (or both) will contain
    at least one interface in the form of either a physical or virtual network device.
    When firewalld is active, each of these interfaces is assigned to a zone allowing
    different levels of firewall security to be assigned to different interfaces.
    Consider a server containing two interfaces, one connected externally to the internet
    and the other to an internal network. In such a scenario, the external facing
    interface would most likely be assigned to the more restrictive external zone
    while the internal interface might use the internal zone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 13.1.3 Services
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TCP/IP defines a set of services that communicate on standard ports. Secure
    HTTPS web connections, for example, use port 443, while the SMTP email service
    uses port 25\. To selectively enable incoming traffic for specific services, firewalld
    rules can be added to zones. The home zone, for example, does not permit incoming
    HTTPS connections by default. This traffic can be enabled by adding rules to a
    zone to allow incoming HTTPS connections without having to reference the specific
    port number.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 13.1.4 Ports
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although common TCP/IP services can be referenced when adding firewalld rules,
    situations will arise where incoming connections need to be allowed on a specific
    port that is not allocated to a service. This can be achieved by adding rules
    that reference specific ports instead of services. This technique was used in
    the chapter entitled [“An Overview of the CentOS 8 Cockpit Web Interface”](../Text/Cockpit_Overview.xhtml#_idTextAnchor081)
    when port 9090 was opened to allow access to the Cockpit web interface.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Port forwarding is used in conjunction with masquerading when the CentOS 8 system
    is acting as a gateway to the internet for an internal network of computer systems.
    Port forwarding allows traffic arriving at the firewall via the internet on a
    specific port to be forwarded to a particular system on the internal network.
    This is perhaps best described by way of an example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose that a CentOS 8 system is acting as the firewall for an internal network
    of computers and one of the systems on the network is configured as a web server.
    Let’s assume the web server system has an IP address of 192.168.2.20\. The domain
    record for the web site hosted on this system is configured with the public IP
    address behind which the CentOS 8 firewall system sits. When an HTTP web page
    request arrives on port 80 the CentOS 8 system acting as the firewall needs to
    know what to do with it. By configuring port forwarding it is possible to direct
    all web traffic to the internal system hosting the web server (in this case, IP
    address 192.168.2.20), either continuing to use port 80 or diverting the traffic
    to a different port on the destination server. In fact, port forwarding can even
    be configured to forward the traffic to a different port on the same system as
    the firewall (a concept known as local forwarding).

- en: A carefully planned and implemented firewall is a vital component of any secure
    system. In the case of CentOS 8, the firewalld service provides a firewall system
    that is both flexible and easy to administer.

- en: The firewalld service uses the concept of zones to group together sets of firewall
    rules and includes a suite of pre-defined zones designed to meet a range of firewall
    protection requirements. These zones may be modified to add or remove rules, or
    entirely new zones created and configured. The network devices on the system that
    connect to networks or the internet are referred to as interfaces. Each interface,
    in turn, is assigned to a zone. The primary tools for working with firewalld are
    the firewall-cmd command-line tool and the firewall-config graphical utility.
    Minimal firewall management options are also available via the Cockpit web interface.
