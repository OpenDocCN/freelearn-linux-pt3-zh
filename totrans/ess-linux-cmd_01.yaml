    is defining your roles and responsibilities. However, how to do this varies greatly
    depending on who you ask. Different individuals and companies may have their own
    unique perspectives on what the title of system administrator entails.

    installations and management commands. Setting up a Linux system and keeping it
    up to date are the basic tasks that most system administrators perform in their
    day-to-day work. In this chapter, we will start by setting up a Linux server and
    then learn about the purpose of package management and how it provides an easy
    way to install software on Linux hosts. We will then explore commands that allow
    us to view the Linux file structure, add users and groups, and archive files.

    and manage Linux servers. We will begin by learning how to download the CentOS
    server installation file, set up a hypervisor, and install packages. We will also
    explore commands that allow you to view system, kernel, hardware, and processor
    information. With the skills you learn in this chapter, you will be able to set
    up and manage Linux servers with confidence.

    options to choose from. Some popular choices include Ubuntu, Debian, and Red Hat.
    However, one of the most popular and stable choices for enterprise and web server
    environments is the **Community Enterprise Operating** **System** (**CentOS**).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CentOS is a free and open source Linux distribution based on **Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux** (**RHEL**). It is known for its stability and reliability, making it a
    popular choice for enterprise and web server environments. It is also widely used
    in the hosting industry, education, research, and for personal use. It is compatible
    with the Red Hat ecosystem, meaning that users can leverage their existing knowledge,
    skills, and tools of RHEL. The distribution is maintained by a large community
    of developers and users who work together to provide updates and security patches,
    making it a secure and stable choice. Additionally, it is designed to be fully
    compatible with the upstream vendor, Red Hat, and it provides an almost identical
    environment. This means that users can use the same set of commands and packages
    as in Red Hat Linux, and they can also access the Red Hat customer portal and
    support. As we’ll be making use of CentOS throughout this book, we’ll be downloading
    the installation image from the official website ([https://www.centos.org/](https://www.centos.org/)).
    The website offers both DVD and minimal ISO images, which can be used to install
    the server. Make sure to download the correct version for your architecture (32-bit
    or 64-bit).

    own IP addresses. In NAT mode, the virtual machine’s network traffic is transparently
    translated between the virtual network and the host’s physical network, allowing
    the virtual machine to access network resources as if it were directly connected
    to the physical network. NAT is often used in virtualization environments for
    testing and development, where virtual machines need access to the internet for
    downloading software, updates, and so on but do not require public access.'

    packages by resolving dependencies and downloading required packages. With YUM,
    users can install new packages, update existing packages, and remove packages
    as needed. YUM provides a command line interface that allows users to manage packages
    from the terminal, as well as a graphical user interface for users who prefer
    a visual approach.

    package, `yum update` to update an existing package, and `yum remove` to remove
    a package. Additionally, `yum list` can be used to list all available packages,
    and `yum search` can be used to search for packages. It is important to remember
    that when using YUM to manage packages, it is necessary to have an active internet
    connection and to run the commands as root or with administrative privileges.

    all installed packages to their latest available version. The command updates
    the system with the latest packages, bug fixes, and security patches, ensuring
    the system remains secure and stable. The `yum upgrade` command is executed in
    the terminal and it is executed with administrative privileges, usually as the
    root user. By running the command, the system will upgrade all installed packages
    and resolve any dependencies or conflicts that might arise during the upgrade

    information about various aspects of the system, including hardware, software,
    networks, and users. These commands are essential tools for monitoring and troubleshooting
    the system and its components, providing insight into the current status, configuration,
    and performance of the system. With the ability to obtain accurate and up-to-date
    information about the system, system administrators can quickly identify and resolve
    issues, ensuring optimal performance and the stability of the system. These commands
    provide information about the system’s hostname, disk usage, processes, CPU, and
    network interfaces, respectively, making them valuable tools for system administrators
    who need to diagnose and resolve system issues.

    help you gather information about your system. Throughout this chapter, we emphasized
    the importance of proper server setup and installations, including regular software
    upgrades and updates, to ensure that your system runs smoothly and remains secure.
    By following the steps outlined in this chapter, you will be well on your way
    to setting up a reliable and secure server for your personal use, as well as building
    a foundation to further learn about Linux system administration.

    up a server. We began by discussing the process of downloading the server’s operating
    system, which is a crucial step in the setup process. We then delved into the
    topic of downloading and setting up a hypervisor, which is a virtualization platform
    that enables the creation of virtual machines. The hypervisor provides an isolated
    environment for each virtual machine, which allows multiple virtual machines to
    run on the same physical server.

    server setup process. These commands allow system administrators to install, upgrade,
    and remove packages from the server, which are essential for the server to function
    properly. We also provided an overview of some common package installation commands
    such as `yum`.

    in the server setup process. These commands provide important information about
    the system, including information about the operating system and the hardware.
    We covered three common information commands in CentOS, including `uname`, `lsb_release`,
    and `hostnamectl`, and described their uses and benefits. These information commands
    are useful for monitoring and troubleshooting the server and ensuring that it
    is functioning optimally.
