- en: CentOS 8 includes the GNOME 3 desktop environment. Although lacking the complexity
    of Windows and macOS desktops, GNOME 3 provides an uncluttered and intuitive desktop
    environment that provides all of the essential features of a windowing environment
    with the added advantage that it can be learned quickly.

    during the CentOS 8 installation process, the GNOME desktop will already be installed
    and will automatically launch each time the system starts.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If any other software configuration was selected during the CentOS 8 installation
    process, the GNOME desktop will not have been included in the packages installed
    on the system. On server-based systems without a display attached, the idea of
    installing a graphical desktop environment may seem redundant. It is worth noting,
    however, that remote access to the GNOME desktop is also possible so, even on
    so called headless servers (i.e. servers lacking a monitor, keyboard and mouse)
    it may still be beneficial to install the GNOME desktop packages. The topic of
    establishing remote desktop access will be covered in detail in the [“CentOS 8
    Remote Desktop Access with VNC”](../Text/Remote_Desktop_Access.xhtml#_idTextAnchor196)
    chapter of this book.

- en: CentOS 8 includes the GNOME 3 desktop environment which may either be included
    during the initial installation or installed later using the dnf group package
    installation feature. Unlike most other desktop environments, GNOME 3 is intended
    to provide a clean and easy to use windowing user interface. Key areas of the
    GNOME 3 desktop include the top bar, Activities overview and dash. In addition,
    GNOME 3 supports multiple workspaces keeping running applications organized and
    the screen uncluttered. A variety of configuration options is also available within
    the Settings app including desktop background settings, audio, network configuration
    and Wi-Fi network selection.
