    understanding of **Information Technology** (**IT**), systems, or administration
    and treat it like a general filler for IT roles that they do not understand or
    know how to name. It also has a strong tendency to be given out in lieu of pay
    raises or promotions to entice junior staff to remain in an otherwise unrewarding
    job in the hopes that an impressive title will help them later in their career,
    so much so that in the end, the number of people working as system administrators
    is a very small number of people compared to the number of people with the title.
    In fact, it is no small stretch to guess that the average person with the title
    of system administrator has never thought about the meaning of the title and may
    have little inkling of what someone in that role would be expected to do.

  zh: 我认为尝试理解系统管理员是什么的最具挑战性的事情之一，源于*系统管理员*这个称号经常被公司随意颁发，几乎没有理解**信息技术**（**IT**）、系统或管理，并将其视为IT角色的通用填充物，他们不理解或不知道如何命名。它还很容易在没有给予薪资加薪或晋升的情况下，以此激励初级员工留在一个其他方面无法奖励的工作中，希望一个令人印象深刻的头衔将帮助他们在以后的职业生涯中。因此，实际上，作为系统管理员工作的人数与拥有这一头衔的人数相比非常少。事实上，可以毫不夸张地猜测，拥有系统管理员头衔的普通人从未思考过这一头衔的含义，也许对这一角色的预期有很少的了解。
- en: 'If we look solely by title, system administrators are everywhere. But they
    exist mostly at companies too small to have plausibly employed a system administrator
    at all. Systems administration as a dedicated job is nearly exclusive to large
    companies. Most companies need someone to do the tasks of system administration,
    but only as a part of, and often only a small part of, their overall duties. It
    is the nature of IT that in small and medium sized companies you typically have
    generalists who *wear many hats* and do every needed IT role while having little
    to no time to focus on any one specific function. Whereas in large enterprises
    you generally get focused roles, often grouped into focused departments, that
    do just a single IT role: such as system administrator. But even in some enterprises
    you find departments organized like separate, small businesses and still having

    of hours of system administration tasks per week and require entire departments
    of dedicated specialists. So just like plumbers, you find small businesses either
    hiring IT generalists (akin to the homeowner's handyman) or outsourcing system
    administration tasks to an outside firm like an **Managed Service Provider** (commonly

    would make no sense to them. They run the systems that the company needs until
    those systems are replaced, generally with a new workload that the administrator
    runs in the same way. An administrator might need to give input to a project manager
    as a project might need to report what its long-term administration impact is
    going to be, or to get the blessings of administration that they are willing to

    and an administrator at the same time is burnout. Being an administrator naturally
    leads to being very busy with requests and always being the first called when
    things go wrong: systems performing slowly, a computer crashing, a new bug discovered,
    and patches needing to be applied. Administrators tend to not only work long hours

  zh: 强求IT人员同时扮演工程师和管理员角色，常常会导致职业倦怠。作为管理员，通常意味着忙于处理请求，且总是当问题发生时第一个被召唤：系统运行缓慢、电脑崩溃、发现新的bug、需要修补程序等。管理员不仅倾向于长时间工作，而且还需频繁待命。能够在可用的时间中休息是他们能否长期保持在这个角色中的关键。
- en: Engineers have no need to be on-call and are not the responsible role during
    an emergency or problem. Engineers, however, would not be expected to need special
    downtime to compensate for the extreme demands on their time and schedule. They
    do not get interrupted, they do not have to carry a beeper (although no one literally
    carries a beeper anymore), they do not miss their kids' school play or have to
    answer questions seconds before boarding a plane, or have to run out of a family
    dinner to walk someone through fixing a problem remotely. They get to live scheduled
    lives where they can rest like normal jobs do. The image of the IT worker running
    ragged and never getting a break, always being expected to drop everything for
    the company, and living off of promises that often never materialize of a chance
    to rest sometime in the future is one of system administrators in nearly all cases.
    No other role carries so much responsibility at the times when it is most critical.

    additional time to get back to the point of productivity where they were before
    the interruption. It does not take much to see that a handful of interruptions
    throughout a day would reduce the effective time of an engineer to essentially
    zero. They might be attempting to work all day, sitting at their desk trying to
    focus on the task, burning through their available time, but if they keep getting
    interruption, they will just spin their wheels and feel more and more exhausted

    a problem, or a request and the worst is a small, atomic chunk that is completed
    before the next interruption takes focus. When a task is completed, or an outage
    resolved the next task to be tackled is a different one whether it is already
    lined up and ready to go or doesn't arrive for some time. The administrator must
    go through task switching between each issue regardless, so the overhead that
    this incurs is a given that cannot be avoided.

    home lab experience has been among the most valuable of my career. And in my role
    as a hiring manager, no matter how much office experience someone has, I always
    want to know what they do at home on their own time. Home labs show dedication,
    interest, passion, and provide unique opportunities to really learn a process
    from end to end. In my decades in system administration, I have found that it
    is actually a rare administrator who has gained any real experience running a
    system from cradle to grave and understanding what a system and workload lifecycle
    are really like. Having that experience, even if only at home, can be a major
    point of differentiation in an interview or on the job. It can easily be the stand
    out factor that makes all of the difference.

    that was onerous in the late 1990s to something that is almost an afterthought
    in the 2020s. The resource needs of a lab are often incredibly small, while the
    spare resources of most computers, by comparison, are large. And this is before
    we consider cloud computing and the ability to do lab work using on demand cloud
    resources today. While not free, cloud computing is often extremely affordable
    as another resource that a home lab can deploy expanding the student''s experience
    even further. Leveraging both gives you even more to put on a resume and to discuss

- en: One of my better career decisions early on in my system administration years
    was to use my free time for a couple of years to volunteer as the sole system
    administrator of an all-Linux environment at a K-12 school. The school had almost
    no existing computers at all, and certainly no network or Internet access, and
    I was able to put on my engineering hat and design their entire environment including
    desktops, servers, telephones, networking, printing, and others. And once implemented,
    I was able to switch to my administrator's hat and manage the entire desktop,
    server, telephone, and storage environment from cradle to grave built entirely
    from Linux. I was able to do everything and do it all myself. I paid the price
    as an administrator for my oversights as an engineer. I saw the initial cost and
    design considerations and how they played out with end users. I deal with a workload
    from procuring the initial hardware, installing the software, configuring, deploying,
    training, and supporting. That experience didn't just catapult me forward in my

    specifically, or systems administration more generally, are the area in which
    you are wanting to focus your attentions.

- en: First, I have to say, that after well more than thirty years in the field very
    little else is as generally rewarding as working in IT. IT isn't just an enormous
    field with countless opportunities, but it is one that gives you geographic opportunity,
    the chance to explore any business market (finance, manufacturing, insurance,
    healthcare, veterinary, hospitality, research, government, military, journalist,
    media, software, tourism, marketing, and so on), and myriad different roles within
    the field. Everyone's IT journey is a unique one, and the chances for your career
    to be rewarding and exciting are higher than in nearly any other field. IT is
    uniquely positioned as not only a technical field, but also as a customer service
    field, but most importantly as a *core business function*. IT builds and maintains
    the business infrastructure. As such we are a key player in every aspect of the
    internals of an individual business, even before we consider the fact that we
    work in all businesses!

- en: 'First, Information Technology. Certainly, this is what *IT* stands for, but
    truly IT is not about technology. It''s about the information, communication,
    storage, security, and the efficiency of the business - the infrastructure of
    the business. As such, technology naturally is assumed, but sometimes IT can be
    about whiteboards, notepads, and just bringing good decision making and common
    sense to the organization. I often compare IT to legal and accounting departments:
    each has a focus, but each also is just *part of the business* itself.'

  zh: 首先是信息技术。毫无疑问，这就是*IT*的含义，但实际上，IT并不仅仅是技术。它关乎信息、通信、存储、安全和业务的效率——即业务基础设施。因此，技术自然而然地被认为是其中的一部分，但有时IT也可能是关于白板、便签以及为组织带来良好的决策和常识。我常常将IT与法律和会计部门进行比较：每个部门都有自己的重点，但它们也只是*业务的一部分*。
- en: Second, we call ourselves professionals because, well to be honest, because
    it sounds great. Everyone wants to be called a professional. This aligns us with
    doctors, lawyers, civil engineers, and so forth. But the truth is, none of those
    are good analogues to what we do in IT. All those fields start with stringent
    certifications, follow exacting rules, and would be *just following the script*
    if their approaches were applied in IT. There is a reason that IT certifications
    are almost exclusively about products rather than roles, and that is because the
    concept of certifying someone for an IT role conceptually doesn't really make
    sense. Why is that?

  zh: 第二，我们自称为专业人士，因为，坦率地说，这听起来很棒。每个人都希望被称为专业人士。这让我们与医生、律师、土木工程师等职业相联系。但事实上，这些职业并不是我们在
    IT 行业中所做工作的良好类比。所有这些领域都有严格的认证要求，遵循精确的规则，如果把它们的方法应用到 IT 行业，结果*只是按部就班*。IT 认证几乎专注于产品而非角色，正是因为概念上给
    IT 角色认证并不太合理。这是为什么呢？
- en: IT roles cannot really be certified in a meaningful way because if you could
    codify IT, you could automate IT, but you can't. IT is primarily creative and
    works as a business function more like the CEO than to any other department. IT's
    job is to maximize the profits of the business through improvements and good decision
    making in business infrastructure, which is an extremely broad mandate. The CEO
    has the same mandate, just without the limitation of being focused on the infrastructure.
    You would never certify someone as a *CEO Professional*, that's crazy. CEOs are
    totally creative, wild, unique. IT is the same way or should be. We would never
    accept a CEO that just did what everyone else did, there would be no value to
    them. Business professionals like the CEO or the IT department are there to take
    massive amounts of information and training; add common sense, experience, and
    creativity; and then apply all of that to a unique business in relationship to
    its customers, market, regulations, and competition. Almost nothing in these roles
    is repeatable on a large scale.

  zh: IT 角色无法以有意义的方式进行认证，因为如果你能将 IT 编码化，你就可以自动化 IT，但实际上做不到。IT 主要是创造性的，并且作为业务功能的角色更像是
    CEO，而非其他任何部门。IT 的工作是通过改善和良好的业务基础设施决策来最大化企业的利润，这是一项极其广泛的任务。CEO 也有相同的任务，只不过他们的任务不局限于基础设施。你永远不会认证某人作为*CEO
    专业人士*，那太疯狂了。CEO 完全是创造性的、狂野的、独特的。IT 也是如此，或者应该是如此。我们永远不会接受一个只是按别人做的 CEO，因为这样的人不会带来任何价值。像
    CEO 或 IT 部门这样的商业专业人士需要处理大量信息和培训，加入常识、经验和创造力，然后将这些全部应用到一个独特的商业环境中，结合它的客户、市场、法规和竞争。几乎在这些角色中，没有什么是可以大规模复制的。
- en: At the end of the day, the IT department, whether just one person or one hundred
    thousand people, has the singular function of helping the company to maximize
    profits. To do that we have to understand the business inside and out, business
    as a general concept, technology, decision making, risk and reward, and so on.
    You can't make those kinds of business decisions, take those kinds of profit risks,
    if you are tied to the confines associated with *professionals*.

- en: A doctor, as a prime example, has so many strict rules to follow and everything
    centers around their *certification* process and their overall focus is all about
    *avoiding mistakes*. A doctor will prioritize any number of lives lost through
    inaction over being the direct cause of a death themselves. The *professional*
    approach is to avoid mistakes at the tactical level, while eschewing the strategic
    level.

- en: IT, like any business function, is the opposite. We must look at the overall
    risk assessment, calculate potential reward, and make decisions that, mathematically,
    make sense for business profits. As IT *professionals*, it's not just okay to
    risk *losing a patient* from time to time, but if we never lose one, chances are
    pretty good that we are too risk averse to make good decisions. IT should never
    be about avoiding failure at all costs (or even just at irrational costs), but
    about choosing the level of risk that is dictated as wise based on the math and
    logic of the situation. For this reason, I often refer to those in our field as
    IT Practitioners because this better reflects the proper mindset that we should
    have when properly representing our field in a company that takes the role of
    the IT department seriously (and, by extension, takes itself seriously.)

  zh: IT，像任何业务职能一样，应该采取相反的思路。我们必须进行全面的风险评估，计算潜在的回报，并做出在数学上对业务利润有意义的决策。作为IT的*专业人员*，偶尔*失去一个患者*并非不可接受，但如果我们从不失去一个患者，那么很可能我们过于规避风险，无法做出好的决策。IT永远不应该是避免任何失败的代价（甚至是非理性的代价），而是根据情况的数学和逻辑，选择一个明智的风险水平。因此，我常常称我们领域的人为IT从业者，因为这个称呼更能反映我们在公司中代表IT部门时应具备的正确心态（而且，间接地，意味着公司重视自身）。

    off alarms in the minds of every executive and manager there, is concepts like
    *we cannot have server downtime at any cost*. This comes up from the normal course
    of risk assessment and discovery. System engineers ask what the value of a system
    is so that they can gauge the needs of risk mitigation only to be told something

- en: Of course, if we really take time to think about it, we know that they are just
    avoiding the question by stating something absurd. We are left with nothing to
    work with, no way to know how to approach system design. No system has zero chance
    of failure, that is not possible. Saying that we must protect against all possible
    failures *at any cost* means that to even attempt to fulfill that demand that
    we just consume literally all resources that the organization can provide purely
    for risk mitigation. Any IT department attempting to follow that directive with
    any sincerity would bankrupt the firm. It should be obvious that no workload,
    in any scenario, is worth that. Yet, it is surprisingly often that company management
    expects IT to work with little other direction in determining which workloads
    get what degree of protection.
