<h1 class="mainHeading" id="_idParaDest-4">Preface</h1>
<p class="normal">Linux is an exciting platform. You can literally find it everywhere—desktops, laptops, phones, embedded appliances, and especially servers. Linux servers power many famous technologies around the world, and have a massive presence in physical and cloud server environments. Linux servers are scalable, stable, and powerful.</p>
<p class="normal">Way back in 1991, a computer science student in Finland, named Linus Torvalds, created a kernel as a school project. He created the Linux kernel. And little did he know at the time, Linux would see us through some of the most exciting innovations in infrastructure design. Things like multicore processors, virtualization, containerization, and cloud computing (to name a few) have transformed data centers all over the world. And Linux has been a part of all of those advancements.</p>
<p class="normal">Ubuntu, a popular distribution of Linux, has been a major driving force in the adoption of Linux. Ever since its first release back in 2004, Ubuntu has made Linux more approachable for newcomers, while simultaneously offering powerful features to server administrators. Ubuntu can be found on notebooks and workstations, in addition to servers.</p>
<p class="normal">Ubuntu Server enables administrators to create efficient, flexible, and highly available servers that empower organizations with the power of open source. As Ubuntu administrators, we’re in good company—according to W3Techs, Ubuntu is the most widely deployed distribution on the web with regard to Linux. With the release of Ubuntu 22.04, this platform becomes even more exciting!</p>
<p class="normal">In this book, we will dive right into Ubuntu Server, and you will learn all the concepts needed to manage your servers and configure them to perform all kinds of neat tasks, such as serving web pages, managing virtual machines, running containers, automating configuration, sharing files with other users, and even running Ubuntu in the cloud.</p>
<p class="normal">We’ll start our journey with the first chapter, where we’ll walk through the installation of Ubuntu Server 22.04, which will serve as a foundation for the rest of the book. As we proceed through our journey, we’ll look at managing users, connecting to networks, and controlling processes. Later, we’ll implement important technologies, such as DHCP, DNS, Apache, MariaDB, and more. We’ll even set up our own Nextcloud server along the way.</p>
<p class="normal">Finally, the end of the book covers various things we can do to troubleshoot issues, as well as preventing and recovering from disasters.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-5">Who this book is for</h1>
<p class="normal">This book is intended for readers with intermediate or advanced-beginner Linux skills, who would like to learn all about setting up servers with Ubuntu Server.

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-7">To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p class="normal">This book is for readers who already have some experience with Linux, though it doesn’t necessarily have to be with Ubuntu. Preferably, the reader will understand basic Linux command-line skills, such as changing directories, listing contents, and issuing commands as regular users or with root. It’s also preferred that the reader understands foundational networking concepts, such as the purpose of things like DHCP, DNS, as well as IP addressing. Even if you feel as though you need a refresher, you should read this book anyway—the opening chapters will cover many of these concepts.</p>
<p class="normal">In this book, we’ll take a look at real-world situations in which we can deploy Ubuntu Server. This will include the installation process, serving web pages, setting up databases, and much more. Specifically, the goal here is to be productive. Each chapter will teach the reader a new and valuable concept, using practical examples that are relative to real organizations. Basically, we focus on getting things done, rather than focusing primarily on theory. Although the theory that goes into Linux and its many distributions is certainly interesting, the goal here is to get you to the point where if a work colleague or client asks you to perform work on an Ubuntu-based server, you’ll be in a good position to get the task done. Therefore, if your goal is to get up and running with Ubuntu Server and learn the concepts that really matter, this book is definitely for you.</p>
<p class="normal">To follow along, you’ll either need a server on which to install Ubuntu Server, a virtual Ubuntu instance from a cloud provider, or a laptop or desktop capable of running at least one virtual machine.</p>
