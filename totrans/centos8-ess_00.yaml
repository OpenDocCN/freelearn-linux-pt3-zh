    being a standard user account with restricted access to many of the administrative
    files and features of the operating system, and the other a superuser (root) account
    with elevated privileges. Typically, a user can gain root access either by logging
    in as the root user, or using the su - command and entering the root password.
    In the following example, a user is gaining root access via the su - command:'

    level privileges. Instead of using the su - command to first gain root access,
    user accounts with administration privileges are able to run otherwise restricted
    commands using sudo.

    than repetitively preface every command-line example with directions to run the
    command as root, the command prompt at the start of the line will be used to indicate
    whether or not the command needs to be performed as root. If the command can be
