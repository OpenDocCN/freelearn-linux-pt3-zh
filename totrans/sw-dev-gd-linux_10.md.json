[expression]\n     find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] -f path [path ...] [expression]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The find utility recursively descends the directory tree for each path listed, evaluating an expression (composed of the \"primaries\" and \"operands\" listed\n     below) in terms of each file in the tree.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -E      Interpret regular expressions followed by -regex and -iregex primaries as extended (modern) regular expressions rather than basic regular expressions\n             (BRE's).  The re_format(7) manual page fully describes both formats.\n\n     -H      Cause the file information and file type (see stat(2)) returned for each symbolic link specified on the command line to be those of the file\n             referenced by the link, not the link itself.  If the referenced file does not exist, the file information and type will be for the link itself.  File\n             information of all symbolic links not on the command line is that of the link itself. \n```", "```\n$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/zsh \n```", "```\n$ env\n...\n# many lines of output, one for each of your environment variables ... \n```", "```\nMYVAR=fruitloops \n```", "```\n$ echo $MYVAR\nfruitloops \n```", "```\nexport MYVAR=fruitloops \n```", "```\nENVIRONMENT\n     The LANG, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES and LC_TIME environment variables affect the execution of the find utility as described in environ(7). \n```", "```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Your program description.\nAfter=network-online.target\n[Service]\nType=exec\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/yourprogram -clioption=1 –clioption2\nEnvironmentFile=-/etc/yourprogram/prod_defaults\nRestart=on-failure\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target \n```", "```\n# yourprogram environment variables\nENV=production\nDB_HOST=localhost\nDB_PORT=5432 \n```", "```\n$ sudo systemd daemon-reload \n```"]
