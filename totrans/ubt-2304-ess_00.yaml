    available today. Praised both for its ease of use and reliability, Ubuntu also
    has a loyal following of Linux users and an active community of developers.

- en: Ubuntu 23.04 Essentials is intended to provide detailed information on the installation,
    use, and administration of the Ubuntu distribution. For beginners, the book covers
    topics such as operating system installation, the basics of the GNOME desktop
    environment, configuring email and web servers, and installing packages and system
    updates. Additional installation topics, such as dual booting with Microsoft Windows,
    are also covered, together with all important security topics, such as configuring
    a firewall and user and group administration.

    web interface, logical volume management (LVM), disk partitioning, swap management,
    KVM virtualization, Secure Shell (SSH), Linux Containers, and file sharing using
    both Samba and NFS are covered in detail to provide a thorough overview of this
    enterprise class operating system.

- en: 'Ubuntu, in common with Linux in general, has two types of user accounts, one
    being a standard user account with restricted access to many of the administrative
    files and features of the operating system and the other a superuser (root) account
    with elevated privileges. Typically, a user can gain root access either by logging
    in as the root user or using the su - command and entering the root password.
    In the following example, a user is gaining root access via the su - command:'
