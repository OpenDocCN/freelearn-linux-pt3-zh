			<p>Linux also offers a wide range of features and tools that are essential for system administration in the cloud, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resource virtualization</strong>: Linux allows system administrators to create and manage <strong class="bold">virtual machines</strong> (<strong class="bold">VMs</strong>), which <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>are isolated<a id="_idIndexMarker606"/> computing environments that can run multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical server. This enables efficient utilization of resources and facilitates dynamic scaling of <span class="No-Break">cloud-based services.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Containerization</strong>: Linux is also a popular platform for containerization, which is a lightweight virtualization technology that allows applications to be packaged and deployed in isolated environments called containers. Containers are highly portable and scalable, making them ideal for running <span class="No-Break">cloud-native applications.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security</strong>: Linux is known for its security features, such as <strong class="bold">Security-Enhanced Linux</strong> (<strong class="bold">SELinux</strong>), which<a id="_idIndexMarker607"/> provides granular control over system access and permissions. This makes Linux a secure platform for running cloud-based workloads, even in <span class="No-Break">multi-tenant environments.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automation</strong>: Linux offers a wide range of tools and frameworks for automating system administration tasks, such as configuration management, deployment, and monitoring. This <a id="_idIndexMarker608"/>enables system administrators to manage large and complex cloud environments efficiently <span class="No-Break">and effectively.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Additionally, Linux distributions such as CentOS prioritize security and stability in the cloud environment. System administrators rely on Linux’s rigorous security protocols and prompt updates to protect cloud-based assets from threats. The open source nature of Linux further empowers administrators to tailor security configurations to meet specific organizational requirements, ensuring the safety of data and applications hosted in <span class="No-Break">the cloud.</span></p>

			<p class="list-inset">Let’s delve into what a <span class="No-Break">VPC is.</span></p>
			<p class="list-inset">A VPC is a fundamental component of AWS and similar cloud computing platforms. It is a virtual network environment that allows users to create and manage a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud infrastructure. VPCs provide an additional layer of security and control over the cloud resources, allowing users to design their own network architecture, define IP address ranges, create subnets, and configure <span class="No-Break">routing tables.</span></p>
			<p class="list-inset">Within a VPC, users can launch and manage a wide range of cloud-based resources, including virtual machines (EC2 instances), databases, load balancers, and more. By segmenting the cloud environment into VPCs, organizations can establish isolated networks that mimic traditional data center infrastructures with the <a id="_idIndexMarker630"/>added <a id="_idIndexMarker631"/>flexibility and scalability of the cloud. This isolation enables users to implement fine-grained security policies, ensuring that only authorized traffic can access resources within the VPC. VPCs also support the creation of VPNs and direct connections to on-premises data centers, facilitating secure hybrid cloud deployments. In summary, VPCs are a cornerstone of cloud networking, offering a flexible and controlled environment for deploying and managing cloud resources while enhancing security and <span class="No-Break">network segmentation.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.17 – 2/2 checks passed</p>
			<p class="list-inset">This indicates that the instance is currently operational and that both of the status checks conducted by AWS EC2 have been <span class="No-Break">successfully completed.</span></p>
			<p>AWS EC2 conducts two types of status checks for each <span class="No-Break">running instance:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>System status checks, which monitor the AWS systems supporting <span class="No-Break">the instance</span></li>
				<li>Instance status checks, which identify issues within the EC2 <span class="No-Break">instance itself</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If one of these status checks fails, the overall status of the instance is marked as <strong class="bold">Impaired</strong>. In such cases, the instance may not function <span class="No-Break">as expected.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Impaired</strong> status indicates that there might be issues with the instance’s health, but it doesn’t automatically mean that the instance is <span class="No-Break">irreparably damaged.</span></p>
			<p>Depending on <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>the <a id="_idIndexMarker648"/>nature of the issue, you may be able to troubleshoot and resolve it without recreating the entire AMI. The specific steps to take to resolve the issue would depend on the nature of the failure.Here are examples of types <span class="No-Break">of issues:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">System status check fails</strong>: If this check fails, it often indicates problems with the underlying infrastructure. AWS may automatically attempt to recover the instance. In some cases, you might need to stop and start the instance or you may need to contact AWS support <span class="No-Break">for assistance.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Instance status check fails</strong>: When this check fails, it generally points to issues within the instance itself, such as software or configuration problems. You can usually access the instance, identify the problem, and apply fixes without creating a <span class="No-Break">new AMI.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the context of the previous screenshot, a <strong class="bold">2/2 checks passed</strong> status confirms that both system <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>and <a id="_idIndexMarker650"/>instance checks have been successfully cleared, signifying that the instance is in a healthy and fully <span class="No-Break">operational state.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>Connecting to a created EC2 instance using PuTTY</h1>
			<p>Establishing a <a id="_idIndexMarker651"/>connection to an EC2 instance within AWS is a fundamental step in harnessing the capabilities of cloud computing. It involves creating a remote link to a virtual server hosted in the AWS cloud infrastructure. This connection allows users to access, manage, and configure the virtual server, taking advantage of the adaptability, scalability, and cost-efficiency provided <span class="No-Break">by AWS.</span></p>
			<p>The primary motivation for connecting to an EC2 instance is to gain secure and efficient remote access to a cloud-based server environment. This connectivity is invaluable for system administrators, developers, and DevOps practitioners, empowering them to perform critical tasks relating to server setup, software installation, real-time monitoring, troubleshooting, and routine maintenance. It enables the seamless administration of server resources and file transfers and the timely implementation of system updates, all without any physical presence at the server’s location. Connecting to an EC2 instance is crucial for deploying and managing web applications, databases, and other cloud-native services. It streamlines collaborative efforts and ensures that cloud resources are accessible from any location, making it an essential component of modern cloud <span class="No-Break">infrastructure management.</span></p>
			<p>The purpose of connecting to an EC2 instance is multifaceted. System administrators use remote access to oversee server configurations, apply security patches, and monitor performance metrics. Developers leverage these connections for deploying and testing applications, debugging procedures, and managing development environments in the cloud. DevOps teams rely on remote connections to streamline server provisioning, configure extensive server fleets, and<a id="_idIndexMarker652"/> efficiently orchestrate complex <strong class="bold">continuous integration/continuous deployment</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) pipelines. Organizations embracing <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as Code</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaC</strong>) principles depend on remote access for programmatically <a id="_idIndexMarker653"/>managing their cloud infrastructure systematically <span class="No-Break">and efficiently.</span></p>
