    the years when taking Red Hat exams. Nothing from the actual exam will be shared,
    but only technical shortcuts and quality-of-life items that might help make your
    life easier. With what you have learned in this book so far and from studying
    the mock exam questions, I am sure you will succeed, but with a few more words
    to the wise, we can make test day less stressful. These are just some things that
    you can do to make life easier during the exam but are not necessary to pass it.
    So, without further ado, let’s get started!

    book it. This is done through the Red Hat exam site, which can be found at [https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/individual-exams](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/individual-exams).
    This allows you to book the exam by either signing up and paying with two training
    credits or $400\. You can book at a testing facility near you or you can book
    a remote exam. A remote exam allows you to use a laptop or desktop in a secure
    location. You need to keep in mind that you cannot be interrupted during the exam
    or they will stop it and you will forfeit the fee. A remote exam requires the
    following items:'

    no paper or pencils around and other electronic devices than your workstation.
    The proctor will tell you what you can and cannot have present during the exam.
    You will need to place your phone away from you, and on silent, in case the exam
    proctor needs to contact you and cannot through the onscreen prompts. You will
    also have to place your ID after it is verified out of sight. You can have a beverage
    for the duration of the exam; however, it will be inspected by the proctor, so
    ensure that there is no writing on the container for the best test-taking experience.
    You will also be allowed to use the bathroom at an interval that the proctor will
    provide you. Please note that if you time your bathroom break at the 1:55 hour
    mark, there is a chance you will not have to perform a second room check outside
    of the check that occurs due to taking a break.

    privacy and full connectivity. As recommended, I have run an Ethernet cable to
    the shed along with a **Uninterruptable Power Supply** (**UPS**) for my laptop.
    I find that using the laptop screen is somewhat difficult as it is smaller than
    I am used to, so I recommend using a monitor you are comfortable with as you will
    want to maximize your space as you are only allowed one monitor. This means if
    you are using a laptop, it will have to remain closed while connected to the monitor,
    as you are not permitted to use two monitors.

    with a built-in camera, ensure that it is enabled. It is much easier for the proctor
    to see everything and for you to be able to position the wired camera more easily
    if you have both of these webcams enabled. The compatibility information can be

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, let’s start with something that can make your life easier right from
    the start. Read all of the directions from top to bottom. The reason I say this
    is because it can save you time if it tells you something specific that can be
    omitted from repetition, such as only doing things on certain servers. It will
    also let you know how things will be graded. By reading the directions, you will
    understand your test environment better and be prepared to dive head-first into
    the material. Anywhere you can save time is a win.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Speaking of time, utilize the full 4 hours for the exam. Do not try and rush
    it to wrap it up sooner; you are not graded on the time it takes other than that
    4-hour window, which is all the time you are allotted for the exam. It will shut
    down your access to the exam when the timer hits 0\. Do not let a question rob
    you of time. If you are better at other items, do those first and come back to
    the tougher questions if you have the time so that you can cover the most ground.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another thing to keep in mind for saving time is to do everything that is not
    specifically called out to a specific user as root. You can always restore the
    SELinux contexts with a `restorecon -Rv <directory>` that may receive the wrong
    context due to the user. By using root, you will not run into issues where you
    might forget to use the sudo command, and being the root user directly makes finding
    files a breeze as you can access the entire file structure. Just be careful, as
    this can lead to permission issues with files and folders, so if the exam tells
    you to use a specific user for an action, do so. This is not best practice in
    everyday life but can be a time saver on the exam.

    you for choosing to go on this journey with me into the world of Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux. It was a pleasure to write this book with the hope that I can help as many
    of you as possible to succeed in your goals of becoming a certified **Red Hat
    Certified Specialist in Services Management and Automation** (**EX358**). This
    exam counts toward the five additional exams needed to receive the **Red Hat Certified
    Architect** (**RHCA**) along with the **Red Hat Certified Expert** (**RHCE**)
    exam. I hope you gained some insights into how I accomplish tasks. However, it’s
    important you know that these are not the only ways you can complete these tasks
    to accomplish your certification goals, but some of the many that will hopefully
    spur you on to the path of victory.
