			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">One of the first problems encountered by users and system administrators these days is that systems tend to run out of disk space to store data. Fortunately disk space is now one of the cheapest IT commodities. In the next two chapters we will look at the steps necessary to configure CentOS 8 to use the space provided via the installation of a new physical or virtual disk drive. </p>&#13;
			<p id="_idParaDest-279" class="Heading-1-1" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span class="Heading11Marker">29.1 </span><a id="_idTextAnchor364"/>Mounted File Systems or Logical Volumes </p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">There are two ways to configure a new disk drive on a CentOS 8 system. One very simple method is to create one or more Linux partitions on the new drive, create Linux file systems on those partitions and then mount them at specific mount points so that they can be accessed. This approach will be covered in this chapter. </p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Another approach is to add the new space to an existing volume group or create a new volume group. When CentOS 8 is installed a volume group is created and named <span class="My-Italic CharOverride-1">cl</span>. Within this volume group are three logical volumes named <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">root</span>, <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">home</span> and <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">swap</span> that are used to store the / and /home file systems and swap partition respectively. By configuring the new disk as part of a volume group we are able to increase the disk space available to the existing logical volumes. Using this approach we are able, therefore, to increase the size of the /home file system by allocating some or all of the space on the new disk to the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">home</span> volume. This topic will be discussed in detail in <a href="../Text/Volume_Groups.xhtml#_idTextAnchor375"><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">“Adding a New Disk to a CentOS 8 Volume Group and Logical Volume”</span></a>. </p>&#13;

			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">This tutorial assumes that a new physical or virtual hard drive has been installed on the system and is visible to the operating system. Once added, the new drive should automatically be detected by the operating system. Typically, the <a id="_idIndexMarker629"/>disk drives in a system are assigned device names beginning hd or sd followed by a letter to indicate the device number. For example, the first device might be <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">/dev/sda</span>, the second <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">/dev/sdb</span> and so on. </p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The following is output from a system with only one disk drive connected to a <a id="_idIndexMarker630"/>SATA controller: </p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># ls /dev/sd*</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">/dev/sda  /dev/sda1  /dev/sda2</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">This shows that the disk drive represented by <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">/dev/sda</span> is itself divided into 2 partitions, represented by <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">/dev/sda1</span> and <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">/dev/sda2</span>. </p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The following output is from the same system after a second hard disk drive has been installed: </p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># ls /dev/sd*</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">/dev/sda /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">As shown above, the new hard drive has been assigned to the device file <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">/dev/sdb</span>. Currently the drive has no partitions shown (because we have yet to create any). </p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">At this point we have a choice of creating partitions and file systems on the new drive and mounting them for access or adding the disk as a physical volume as part of a volume group. To perform the former continue with this chapter, otherwise read <a href="../Text/Volume_Groups.xhtml#_idTextAnchor375"><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">“Adding a New Disk to a CentOS 8 Volume Group and Logical Volume”</span></a> for details on configuring Logical Volumes. </p>&#13;

			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">A journaling filesystem keeps a journal or log of the changes that are being made to the filesystem during disk writing that can be used to rapidly reconstruct corruptions that may occur due to events such as a system crash or power outage. </p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">There are a number of advantages to using a journaling file system. Both the size and volume of data stored on disk drives has grown exponentially over the years. The problem with a non-journaled file system is that following a crash the <a id="_idIndexMarker635"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">fsck</span> (filesystem consistency check) utility has to be run. The <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">fsck</span> utility will scan the entire filesystem validating all entries and making sure that blocks are allocated and referenced correctly. If it finds a corrupt entry it will attempt to fix the problem. The issues here are two-fold. First, the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">fsck</span> utility will not always be able to repair damage and you will end up with data in the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">lost+found</span> directory. This is data that was being used by an application but the system no longer knows where it was referenced from. The other problem is the issue of time. It can take a very long time to complete the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">fsck</span> process on a large file system, potentially leading to unacceptable down time.</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">A journaled file system, on the other hand, records information in a log area on a disk (the journal and log do not need to be on the same device) during each write. This is a essentially an “intent to commit” data to the filesystem. The amount of information logged is configurable and ranges from not logging anything, to logging what is known as the “metadata” (i.e. ownership, date stamp information etc), to logging the “metadata” and the data blocks that are to be written to the file. Once the log is updated the system then writes the actual data to the appropriate areas of the filesystem and marks an entry in the log to say the data is committed.</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">After a crash the filesystem can very quickly be brought back on-line using the journal log, thereby reducing what could take minutes using <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">fsck</span> to seconds with the added advantage that there is considerably less chance of data loss or corruption.</p>&#13;

			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">This chapter has covered the topic of adding an additional physical or virtual disk drive to an existing CentOS 8 system. This is a relatively simple process of making sure the new drive has been detected by the operating system, creating one or more partitions on the drive and then making filesystems on those partitions. Although a number of different filesystem types are available on CentOS 8, XFS is generally the recommended option. Once the filesystems are ready, they can be mounted using the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">mount</span> command. So that the newly created filesystems mount automatically on system startup, additions can be made to the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">/etc/fstab</span> configuration file.</p>&#13;
