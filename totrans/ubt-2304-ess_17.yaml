- en: Ubuntu can be configured to provide remote access to the graphical desktop environment
    over a network or internet connection. Although not enabled by default, it is
    relatively straightforward to display and access an Ubuntu desktop from a system
    anywhere else on a network or the internet. This can be achieved regardless of
    whether that system is running Linux, Windows, or macOS. In fact, there are even
    apps available for Android and iOS that will allow you to access your Ubuntu desktop
    from just about anywhere that a data signal is available.

- en: Remote desktop access can be useful in a number of scenarios. It enables you
    or another person, for example, to view and interact with your Ubuntu desktop
    environment from another computer system either on the same network or over the
    internet. This is useful if you need to work on your computer when you are away
    from your desk, such as while traveling. It is also useful in situations where
    a co-worker or IT support technician needs access to your desktop to resolve a
    problem.

- en: The Ubuntu remote desktop supports connections using either Virtual Network
    Computing (VNC) or Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). An advantage of
    using RDP is that it makes the Ubuntu desktop easily accessible from Windows clients.
    In this chapter, therefore, we will cover the key aspects of configuring and using
    remote desktops within Ubuntu using RDP.

- en: Before starting, it is important to understand that there are essentially two
    types of remote desktop access. The approach covered in this chapter is useful
    if you primarily use Ubuntu as a desktop operating system and require remote access
    to your usual desktop session. When configured, you will take over your desktop
    session and view and control it remotely.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second option is intended for situations where you need to start and access
    one or more remote desktop sessions on a remote server-based system, regardless
    of whether the remote system has a graphical console attached. This allows you
    to launch multiple desktop sessions in the background on the remote system and
    view and control those desktops over a network or internet connection.

- en: In this chapter, we will cover both secure and insecure remote desktop access
    methods. Assuming that you are accessing one system from another within the context
    of a secure internal network then it is generally safe to use the insecure access
    method. If, on the other hand, you plan to access your desktop remotely over any
    kind of public network, you must use the secure method of access to avoid your
    system and data being compromised.

- en: Remote access to the GNOME desktop environment of an Ubuntu system can be enabled
    by making use of Virtual Network Computing (VNC) or the Remote Desktop Protocol
    (RDP). Comprising the server running on the remote server and a corresponding
    client on the local host, VNC and RDP allow remote access to desktop instances
    running on the server.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The standard remote server solution for the GNOME desktop is Vino. Once installed,
    remote desktop sessions can be established from other Linux systems using a remote
    desktop viewer such as Remmina. When using RDP, the desktop is also accessible
    to Windows and Mac systems using the Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection application.
