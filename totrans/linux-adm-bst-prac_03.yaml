    to wondering what flavor of Linux we are going to be talking about. This is typically
    the first topic that pops into our minds when having even a casual conversation
    with a business owner or someone in another, non-technical department. What we
    rarely spend much time thinking about is release and support models and how these
    play into our planning, risk, and expenditure models.

    are used constantly and no one is surprised to hear them but like with all things
    technical as the adoption rate of a term increases the general understanding of
    it likely decreases. Therefore, we need to investigate some nuances of licensing

    world, at least from a legal perspective.

    Simply by being a Linux-based system actually tells us incredibly little about
    what a device might be doing or how it might be used. Unlike macOS, which essentially
    guarantees that the use case is either a desktop or a laptop end user device,
    or Windows Server, which all but assures us that a system is an infrastructure
    or line of business (LOB) server. Having a system be built on Linux gives us very
    little to go on when looking to determine the intended use of that system. Linux
    is used on servers, in virtualization, in desktops, laptops, tablets, routers,
    firewalls, phones, IoT devices, appliances, and more. Linux is everywhere. And
    Linux is doing just about everything that there is to do. There are almost no
    roles that Linux does not cover, at least some of the time.'

    mean. Linux is only a kernel, one piece of a UNIX operating system. But operating
    systems built on Linux are, by and large, UNIX - at least according to the most
    definitive possible source, Dennis Ritche, one of the creators of UNIX. Linux
    implements both the UNIX approach and ecosystem, as well as the UNIX interfaces.
    It is a UNIX, just as FreeBSD and others are. UNIX is both a standard and a trademark.
    But the two are not necessarily maintained together. The waters are a bit muddy
    here. But standard Linux systems, any that we will be discussing in this book,
    implement the UNIX standard (known as POSIX originally and now a super set of
    POSIXs, known as SUS). So, they are a UNIX variant or derivative, just as Dennis
    Ritchie said that they were way back in 1999\. He said the same thing about the
    BSD operating system family, as well.

    Ritche，他是UNIX的创始人之一。Linux实现了UNIX的方法和生态系统，以及UNIX接口。它是UNIX，就像FreeBSD和其他操作系统一样。UNIX既是一个标准，也是一个商标。但这两者并不一定是一起维护的。这里的水有点混乱。不过，标准的Linux系统，我们在本书中讨论的所有系统，都实现了UNIX标准（最初称为POSIX，现在是POSIX的超集，称为SUS）。因此，它们是UNIX的变体或衍生物，正如Dennis
    Ritchie在1999年所说的那样。他当时也对BSD操作系统家族说了同样的话。
- en: 'But the story is a little better than that. While most operating systems built
    from Linux have never bothered to pay for any kind of UNIX certification, one
    of them recently did: EulerOS by Huawei which is built from CentOS, which in turn,
    is built from Fedora. Only EulerOS as a product officially carries the UNIX trademark
    designation, but it shows that the broader ecosystem is meeting the specifications.
    The nature of the certification process is that it makes it easy and obvious to
    certify large, proprietary, commercially backed UNIX projects such AIX or macOS.
    But in the Linux space where each distribution counts as a unique operating system
    and often defining exactly which OS is unique from another is a bit of a gray
    area (Is Kubuntu covered under Ubuntu? Is Ubuntu covered under Debian?) and where
    projects are often volunteer efforts that have no revenue source to cover a meaningless
    certification process it would be all but impossible to certify them through a
    complicated and expensive certification process, especially when that process
    has no value. In reality, the Linux and BSD ecosystems have demonstrated that
    the utility of the UNIX certification process has run its course and the process
    is now detrimental to the industry and serves no purpose. At the end of the day,
    being compatible with UNIX is worthless, it is Linux and BSD that other systems
    want to maintain compatibility with.'

  zh: 但事情比这稍微复杂一些。虽然大多数基于Linux构建的操作系统从未花费过任何费用来获得UNIX认证，但其中一个最近做到了：华为的EulerOS，它基于CentOS，而CentOS又基于Fedora。只有EulerOS作为产品正式拥有UNIX商标认证，但它显示出更广泛的生态系统正在符合这些规范。认证过程的特点是，它使得像AIX或macOS这样的商业化支持的大型专有UNIX项目容易且显而易见地获得认证。但在Linux领域，由于每个发行版都算作一个独立的操作系统，而且通常很难明确区分一个操作系统与另一个操作系统的不同（比如Kubuntu是否包含在Ubuntu内？Ubuntu是否包含在Debian内？），而且许多项目通常是志愿者的工作，无法提供收入来支付一个无意义的认证过程，因此几乎不可能通过一个复杂且昂贵的认证过程对其进行认证，尤其是当这个过程没有价值时。实际上，Linux和BSD生态系统已经证明了UNIX认证过程的实用性已经走到了尽头，且该过程对行业有害，已无任何意义。最终，与UNIX兼容是毫无价值的，Linux和BSD才是其他系统想要保持兼容的对象。
- en: Microsoft demonstrated this last point beautifully in the last few years when
    their traditional UNIX compatibility layer called Windows SFU (Windows Subsystem
    for UNIX) was rebuilt and renamed WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and intentionally
    made fully compatible with Linux in order to be able to run Linux-based operating
    systems on top of the Windows kernel. Microsoft, once the largest maker of traditional

    and try to understand where the products on the market today have come from! At
    this point, UNIX is well over fifty years old and Linux turns thirty years old
    this year, in 2021! These are old systems with a lot of history and both UNIX
    and Linux being rooted at least partially in open source has made for so many
    different *stories* all stemming from one beginning. Unlike a product like Windows,
    which is complex enough as it is, UNIX isn't the product of a single vendor and
    is not really a product on its own. So, the story of what we have today is complex.

    IT knowledge. Knowing the basics of current vendors and distributions is very
    important, but knowing who came first, who is older, from whose work they built
    and so forth is banal. All of today's key vendors are nearing twenty years old
    or older and so all of the people involved in the early days are all gone. Even
    the vendors themselves would struggle to track down their products' own histories
    at this point.

    easy to find at least reasonably qualified candidates. Run a series of interviews
    and almost every candidate will be able to do the job, even if not well. But run
    a similar interview looking for the exact same position but for Windows instead
    of for Linux and you will likely get twice or thrice the candidates to wade through

    allow or require work to be done from a GUI, rather than from a command line.
    This means that most people who have never done a task before can simply poke
    around, apply some basic common sense, read what is on the screen and appear to
    a casual observer to be able to do system administration duties, even if they
    have never seen a server before in their lives. But nearly all Linux shops allow
    no GUIs on servers and when they do have no administration tools in the GUI forcing
    all work to be done at the command line where it is far harder to simply look
    around and hope for the best. Familiarity with the commands and outcomes is very
    much needed. Basically, bluffing is much harder. This isn't because Linux is harder,
    at all. Not in the least.
  id: totrans-88

- en: This is because of a culture in the Linux world of GUIs being unacceptable on
    servers and the opposite culture in the Windows world. In the early days, in the
    early 1990s, Linux had no GUI, and everything was done at the command line and
    at the same time Windows was GUI only and the full command line capability wasn't
    added until decades later. This started a trend that has remained to this day.
    If you talk to someone who works on Linux as an administrator, they will simply
    assume that everything is command line only and have the same conversation with
    a Windows admin and while they will be familiar with the command line, they will
    almost universally assume that it is a partial tool used in conjunction with the
    GUI. Of course, if you wanted to administer Windows completely from PowerShell
    today, you can and you can do so very well. And likewise, if you really wanted
    to, Linux can be administrated from a GUI. No one does because that's a bad idea,
    but it is possible.

    title of system administrator where little, if any, administration work has really
    happened. In the late 1990s and early 2000s we had a problem that Microsoft and
    other certification vendors were handing out certifications like candy on Halloween
    with many, possibly most, people obtaining certifications doing so through brain
    dumps or boot camps and having no experience and potentially even no knowledge
    of Windows or system administration. The use of these *paper administrators*,
    as they came to be known, threatened to break many IT shops that thought that
    they had an easy way to hire without doing any validation of their own and ended
    up with the industry developing a culture of IT often having no knowledge or training
    which, given the critical position that IT staff is in, putting companies at severe
    risk, but because IT is so complicated, companies often failed to identify the
    failings of the process, even after the fact as few companies do *post mortems*
    on things like hiring processes. Most companies would not even know how or where
    to begin to evaluate the efficacy of decision processes in that way, so they simple
    ignore it.

    In the last few years alternative CPU architectures have started to gain a foothold.

    the AMD64 architecture (there were always niches of alternative architectures
    out there, but they were truly niche for many years) with all other major contenders
    failing completely or being relegated to very specialty roles. But around 2020

    big deal. Choosing the wrong distribution can result in poor performance or installation
    problems or even stability problems long term. It is common for vendors to officially
    support more operating systems than they regularly test against. For example,
    perhaps a vendor uses Debian in their development lab and tests every release
    against it, but only tests Fedora once a year or so, even though Fedora is on
    their support list. If you choose Fedora thinking that the vendor supports it,
    you might find deployment or stability problems with the application on Fedora
    long before the vendor does, and you might find them ill prepared to support something
    outside of their ken. This is the fault of the vendor for not making it clear
    enough that all of their support is not equal, but it is a very common scenario.
    Even a vendor who does an excellent job of supporting and testing many release
    targets still has one or two that they test more frequently or heavily. Generally,
    this is the operating system in use by their developers.

    performance differences less from core features like the kernel configuration
    or system libraries, but much more likely to see differences caused by things
    like different programming language versions which can often vary widely between
    distributions based on several factors behind the scenes that are determined by
    the distribution's governance.

    to determine what is the right distribution for us. In an ideal world, operating
    system and hardware considerations would also play a part in the selection of
    workloads in the first place, but in reality, it is shockingly rare for organizations
    to take a holistic view of their entire business and instead often make decisions,
    such as which applications to deploy, in isolation without considering how that
    will impact the business across the board. As system administrators we often have

    Windows Vista, while *Windows XP SP2* was a minor release coming between *Windows
    XP SP1* and *Windows XP SP3*. Red Hat follows a similar and easy to understand

    continue to work on a major release for its entire lifecycle. Therefore most software

    issues with software as long as your major release does not change. Of course,
    in practice there is always a risk anytime that there is a change, no matter how
    minor it is supposed to be, that some compatibility will change. The purpose of
    minor releases is to be able to provide new functionality and bigger updates that

    firms such as Managed Service Providers (MSPs). Nearly any product can get some
    level of support via third parties, which can lead to an unclear support situation

    be first party.

    products really have this kind of assistance. Linux gets more attention, most
    likely, because there tends to be more knowledge in the field and very little
    is secreted by the vendor, as is the nature of open source. Closed source software
    gets less benefit from community support because details must be either discovered
    through luck or released by the vendor. Community support often gets a lack of
    respect from management, but it is actually an important sign of what makes the
    Linux ecosystem strong: vendors that make everything public and communities of
    professionals looking to support one another. In many cases community support
    is so significant that it can completely change how we approach a product and

    time frame. With Ubuntu this means updating to the current release at least every
    nine months and with Fedora at least every thirteen months. In both of these cases,
    and in most normal cases, these are in place updates done with just a command
    or two not situations that involve replacing one solution with another. So, while
    we may call these short term support approaches, in practice they are quite the

    of third-party products.

    then a rolling release easily can pull into the lead in terms of the best support,
    security, and features. If we need to support third party applications on top
    of the operating system then we will mostly favor rapid releases, instead.

    an operating system for a desktop or a server, and never deploy another application
    on top of it but run the system only for components that are included in the operating
    system itself. If you come from the Windows world this is likely extra strange
    to contemplate as the operating system itself is so devoid of extra components.

    On my desktop devices nearly every tool that I use comes included with my operating
    system. In fact, the Chromebook ecosystem is designed completely around this concept.
    In Linux servers we see this happen a lot as well with many components from web
    servers to databases all included in the operating system.

    few system administrators ever take the time to really understand what it means.
    Now that you understand what each model means you will be able to apply future
    offerings from potentially new vendors and use that to make decisions for your
    organization. You already have a jump on many in the industry who tend to gloss
    over or ignore these types of decisions as if they are trivial when they can result
    in significant implications if chosen incorrectly.

    called in the Linux world, can be far more of a challenge than it seems like it
    should be. You might be *lucky* and work for a company that has a pre-determined
    Linux distro standard that you have to follow, and this question is already answered
    for you. This is becoming an increasingly rare scenario, though, as companies
    begin to realize the benefits of using the right distro for the right use case,
    and as it becomes better known that the idea that skills standardization just
    doesn't benefit from keeping systems identical as much as it was commonly assumed.
    But the practice still exists.

    system over workload choices. There is relatively little value in forcing a specific
    operating system choice and making application choices based on that. Of course,
    in an ideal world, all factors are considered and weighed and licensing, support
    knowledge, standardization and other factors heavily impacting operating system
    choice will play a role, they tend to be pretty small in comparison to application
    choice factors. And that's assuming that we are considering Windows, macOS, and
    some *Linux variant*; if the decision is just about one Linux option or another
    then the differences between distributions drops considerably.

    are tempted to install a single Ubuntu server for a specific workload, the value
    of figuring out how to get that workload working on RHEL or considering another
    workload might be reasonable given the scale of standardization that we are talking
    about. But it's very rare that an IT shop will ever be in a position to have hundreds
    or thousands of operating system images that are homogenous. Very much an edge
    case scenario.

    then applying any homogeneity factors, we then can factor in release and support
    models that best suit the needs of the application and the business. Risk aversion
    and affinity is, of course, a major factor.

    is evaluating risks and balancing those risks against opportunity and reward.
    Reducing risk factors to pure math can be difficult to do, often impossible, but
    even if we cannot simply create numbers to show us what risk and reward levels
    are in any given decision this should not change the fundamental fact that our
    goal is to apply math and logic to a situation to decide the best course of action.

    frequency is risk aversion. This might sound counter intuitive, but it is not.
    If risk aversion, or truly conservative business practices, are based in reason
    and logic then this should increase a business' chances of survival. Rarely is
    this the case, however. Most risk aversion is emotional and illogical and emotional
    decisions, especially when made around risk, almost always result in more risk
    rather than less, regardless of what the intended outcome was to be. Much as how
    a panic response will rarely save you in a dangerous situation, an emotional panic-like
    response to business decisions will almost entirely remove your ability to make
    good decisions.

    Choosing an operating system might be a tiny individual component taken on its
    own, but it is a common view into the workings of a business' decision-making
    machinery. If a business requires expensive vendor support or risk slow-release
    cycles out of fear rather than out of calculated risk assessment, this tells us
    a lot about how decision making is viewed as a process.

    that, I believe, tend to actually be pretty important in our roles in system administration.
    We learned how Linux fits into modern organizations and where it comes from historically
    which might give us some view into where it is going, as well. We dove into open-source
    licensing and how software licensing plays a role in how we work with our operating
