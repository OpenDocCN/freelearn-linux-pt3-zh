- en: Many software engineers are new to Unix-like systems, even though these systems
    are everywhere in the software engineering world. Whether developers know it or
    not, they’re expected to work with Unix-like systems running in their work environment
    (macOS), their software development process (Docker containers), their build and
    automation tooling (CI and GitHub), their production environments (Linux servers
    and containers), and more.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for software developers who are new to Linux and the command line,
    or who are out of practice and want to quickly dust off their skills. If you still
    feel a bit insecure about your abilities when you’re staring at a Linux command-line
    prompt on a production server at 2:00 in the morning, this book is for you. If
    you want to quickly fill a Linux skills gap to advance your career, this book
    is for you. If you’re just curious, and you want to see what kind of efficiency
    gains you can make in your day-to-day development setup and routines by adding
    some command-line magic, this book will serve you as well.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the ways we have tried to fulfill our vision for this kind of uniquely
    useful book is by being extremely careful about what’s included. We’ve tried to
    cut out everything that isn’t essential to your life as a developer, or to a basic
    understanding of Linux and its core abstractions. In other words, the reason this
    book is useful is because of *all the things we left out*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is not a full Linux course. It’s not for people working as Linux system
    engineers or kernel developers. Because of this, it’s not 750+ pages long, and
    you should be able to work through it in a few days, perhaps during a quiet sprint
    at work.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 1*, *How the Command Line Works*, explains how a command-line interface
    works, what a shell is, and then immediately gives you some basic Linux skills.
    You’ll get a bit of theory and then begin moving around on the command line, finding
    and working with files and learning where to look for help when you get stuck.
    This chapter caters to new developers by teaching the most important command-line
    skills. If you read nothing else, you’ll still be better off than when you started.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Working with Processes*, will take you on a guided tour of Linux
    processes. You’ll then dive into useful, practical command-line skills for working
    with processes. We’ll add detail to a few aspects that are a common source of
    process-related problems that you’ll encounter as a software developer, like permissions,
    and give you some heuristics for troubleshooting them. You’ll also get a quick
    tour of some advanced topics that will come up again later in the book.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Service Management with systemd*, builds on the knowledge about
    processes learned in the previous chapter by introducing an additional layer of
    abstraction, the `systemd` service. You’ll learn about what an `init` system does
    for an operating system, and why you should care. Then, we cover all the practical
    commands you’ll need for working with services on a Linux system.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Using Shell History*, is a short chapter covering some tricks
    that you can learn to improve your speed and efficiency on the command line. These
    tricks revolve around using shortcuts and leveraging shell history to avoid repeated
    keystrokes.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Introducing Files*, introduces files as the essential abstraction
    through which to understand Linux. You’ll be introduced to the **Filesystem Hierarchy
    Standard** (**FHS**), which is like a map that you can use to orient yourself
    on any Unix system. Then it’s time for practical commands for working with files
    and directories in Linux, including some special filetypes you probably haven’t
    heard of. You’ll also get a taste of searching for files and file content, which
    is one of the most powerful bits of knowledge to have at your fingertips as a
    developer.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Editing Files on the Command Line*, introduces two text editors
    – nano and vim. You will learn the basics of using these text editors for command-line
    editing while also becoming aware of common editing mistakes and how to avoid
    them.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 7*, *Users and Groups*, will introduce you to how the concepts of
    users and groups form the basis for the Unix security model, controlling access
    for resources like files and processes. We’ll then teach you the practical commands
    you’ll need to create and modify users and groups.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Ownership and Permissions*, builds on the previous chapter’s
    explanation of users and groups to show you how access control works for resources
    in Linux. This chapter teaches you about ownership and permissions by walking
    you through file information from a long listing. From there, we’ll look at the
    common file and directory permissions that you’ll encounter on production Linux
    systems, before engaging with the Linux commands for modifying file ownership
    and permissions.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 9*, *Managing Installed Software*, shows you how to install software
    on various Linux distributions (and even macOS). First, we introduce package managers,
    which are the preferred way of getting software onto a machine: you’ll learn the
    important theory and practical commands for the package management operations
    you’ll need as a software developer. Then we’ll introduce a few other methods,
    like downloading install scripts and the time-honored, artisanal Unix tradition
    of compiling your own software locally, from source (it’s not as scary as it sounds!).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 10*, *Configuring Software*, piggybacks off the previous chapter’s
    focus on installing software by helping you with configuring software on a Linux
    system. You will learn about the places that most software will look for configuration
    (“the configuration hierarchy”). Not only will this knowledge come in handy during
    late-night troubleshooting sessions, but it can actually help you to write better
    software. We’ll cover command-line arguments, environment variables, configuration
    files, and how all of this works on non-standard Linux environments like Docker
    containers. There’s even a little bonus project: you’ll see how to take a custom
    program and turn it into its own `systemd` service.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 11*, *Pipes and Redirection*, will give you an introduction to what
    is possibly the “killer feature” of Unix: the ability to connect existing programs
    into a custom solution using pipes. We’ll move through the prerequisite theory
    and practical skills you need to understand: file descriptors and input/output
    redirection. Then you’ll jump into creating complex commands using pipes. You’ll
    be introduced to some essential CLI tools and practical pipe patterns, which you’ll
    still find yourself using long after you finish this book.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 12*, *Automating Tasks with Shell Scripts*, serves as a Bash scripting
    crash course, teaching you how to go from typing individual commands in an interactive
    shell to writing scripts. We assume you’re already a software developer, so this
    will be a quick introduction that shows you the core language features and doesn’t
    spend a lot of time re-explaining the basics of programming. You’ll learn about
    Bash syntax, best practices for script writing, and some important pitfalls to
    avoid.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 13*, *Secure Remote Access with SSH*, explores the Secure Shell Protocol
    and the related command-line tools available to you. You’ll learn the basics of
    **public-key cryptography** (**PKI**), which is always useful for a developer
    to know, before diving into creating SSH keys and securely logging into remote
    systems over the network. You’ll build on this knowledge and get some experience
    copying files over the network, using SSH to create ad-hoc proxies or VPNs, and
    see examples of various other tasks that involve moving data over an encrypted
    SSH tunnel.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 14*, *Version Control with Git*, shows you how to use a tool you probably
    already know well – `git` – from the command line, instead of through your IDE
    or a graphical client. We quickly go through the basic theory behind git and then
    jump into the commands you’ll need to use in a command-line environment. We’ll
    cover two powerful features that it pays to understand – bisecting and rebasing
    – and then give you our take on best practices and useful shell aliases. Finally,
    the *Poor man’s GitHub* section presents a small but legitimately useful project
    that you can do to practice and integrate the Linux skills you’ve learned up to
    this point.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 15*, *Containerizing Applications with Docker*, gives you the basic
    theory and practical skills that will make it easy to work with Docker as a developer.
    We’ll explore the problems that Docker solves, explain the most important Docker
    concepts, and take you through the core workflow and commands you’ll use. You’ll
    also see how to build your own images by containerizing a real application. And
    because we’re approaching this from a software development and Linux perspective,
    you’ll also develop a good intuition for how containerization works under the
    hood, and how it’s different from virtual machines.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 16*, *Monitoring Application Logs*, gives an overview of logging on
    Unix and Linux. We’ll show you how (and where) logs are collected on most modern
    Linux systems using `systemd`, and how more traditional approaches work (you’ll
    come across both in the real world). You’ll build practical command-line skills
    finding and viewing logs and learn a bit about how logging is being done in larger
    infrastructures.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 17*, *Load Balancing and HTTP*, covers the basics of HTTP for developers,
    with a special focus on the complexities that you’ll come across when working
    with HTTP services in larger infrastructures. We’ll correct some common misunderstandings
    about HTTP statuses, HTTP headers, and HTTP versions and how applications should
    handle them. We’ll also introduce how load balancers and proxies work in the real
    world, and how they make the experience of troubleshooting a live application
    quite different from troubleshooting a development version on your laptop. Many
    of the Linux skills that you will have learned up to this point will come in handy
    here, and we’ll introduce a new tool – `curl` – to help you troubleshoot a wide
    variety of HTTP-related issues.'

    for the best experience, follow along on a Linux operating system.

    skills that you already have as a software developer – editing text, working with
    files and folders, having some notion of what “operating systems” are, installing
    software, and using a development environment. Everything beyond that, we’ll teach
    you.
