- en: In terms of an operating system, we will, of course, assume you are using CentOS
    8\. As previously mentioned, CentOS 8 supports the Apache web server which can
    easily be installed once the operating system is up and running. A domain name
    can be registered with any domain name registration service.

- en: If you are running CentOS 8 on a cloud instance, the IP address assigned by
    the provider will be listed in the server overview information. If you are hosting
    your own server and your internet service provider (ISP) has assigned a static
    IP address then you will need to associate your domain with that address. This
    is achieved using a name server and all domain registration services will provide
    this service for you.

    address which changes frequently) then you can use one of a number of free Dynamic
    DNS (DDNS or DynDNS for short) services which map your dynamic IP address to your
    domain name.

- en: The web server and web site created so far in this chapter use the HTTP protocol
    on port 80 and, as such, is considered to be insecure. The problem is that the
    traffic between the web server and the client (typically a user’s web browser)
    is transmitted in clear text. In other words the data is unencrypted and susceptible
    to interception. While not a problem for general web browsing, this is a serious
    weakness when performing tasks such as logging into web sites or transferring
    sensitive information such as identity or credit card details.
  id: totrans-74
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These days, web sites are expected to use HTTPS which uses either Secure Socket
    Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish secure, encrypted communication
    between web server and client. This security is established through the use of
    public, private and session encryption together with certificates.
  id: totrans-75
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To support HTTPS, a web site must have a certificate issued by a trusted authority
    known as a Certificate Authority (CA). When a browser connects to a secure web
    site, the web server sends back a copy of the web site’s SSL certificate which
    also contains a copy of the site’s public key. The browser then validates the
    authenticity of the certificate with trusted certificate authorities.
  id: totrans-76
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the certificate is found to be valid, the browser uses the public key sent
    by the server to encrypt a session key and passes it to the server. The server
    decrypts the session key using the private key and uses it to send an encrypted
    acknowledgment to the browser. Once this process is complete, the browser and
    server use the session key to encrypt all subsequent data transmissions until
    the session ends.

    server. Both insecure (HTTP) and secure (HTTPS) web sites can be deployed on CentOS
    8\. Secure web sites use either Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) to establish encrypted communication between the web server and client through
    the use of public, private and session encryption together with a certificate
    issued by a trusted Certificate Authority.
