			<h1 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Tips and Tricks to Help with the Exam</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover different tips and tricks I have learned over the years when taking Red Hat exams. Nothing from the actual exam will be shared, but only technical shortcuts and quality-of-life items that might help make your life easier. With what you have learned in this book so far and from studying the mock exam questions, I am sure you will succeed, but with a few more words to the wise, we can make test day less stressful. These are just some things that you can do to make life easier during the exam but are not necessary to pass it. So, without further ado, let’s <span class="No-Break">get started!</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Scheduling <span class="No-Break">your exam</span></li>
				<li>Test-taking tips <span class="No-Break">and tricks</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>We will be using the setup of the systems that were noted in <a href="B18607_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Block Storage – Learning How to Provision Block Storage on Red Hat Enterprise Linux</em>. We will utilize this setup along with the setup from the additional nics for the team exercise, which can be found in <a href="B18607_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor027"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Network File Storage – Expanding Your Knowledge of How to Share Data</em>. This will allow us to solve all of the upcoming questions as if we were in an actual <span class="No-Break">test environment.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Scheduling your exam</h1>
			<p>First things first, before<a id="_idIndexMarker625"/> we get into tips on taking the exam, you need to book it. This is done through the Red Hat exam site, which can be found at <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/individual-exams">https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/individual-exams</a>. This allows you to book the exam by either signing up and paying with two training credits or $400. You can book at a testing facility near you or you can book a remote exam. A remote exam allows you to use a laptop or desktop in a secure location. You need to keep in mind that you cannot be<a id="_idIndexMarker626"/> interrupted during the exam or they will stop it and you will forfeit the fee. A remote exam requires the <span class="No-Break">following items:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer257" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.01_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.1 – Remote exam requirements"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.1 – Remote exam requirements</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, you can see the remaining requirements for taking a <span class="No-Break">remote exam:</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.2 – Additional remote exam requirements</p>
			<p>After you have purchased<a id="_idIndexMarker627"/> the exam, you can use the scheduler to set up your exam either remotely or at a facility near you. As you can see here in the scheduler, I have one exam that is available <span class="No-Break">to schedule:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer259" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.03_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.3 – Exam available to schedule in the Red Hat exam scheduler"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.3 – Exam available to schedule in the Red Hat exam scheduler</p>
			<p>After I choose the exam to schedule, I am <a id="_idIndexMarker628"/>then presented with the following screen with options for a location, such as the United States, and what type of exam I would like to take, either at a facility <span class="No-Break">or remotely:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer260" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.04_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.4 – Choosing your exam type"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.4 – Choosing your exam type</p>
			<p>In my case, I have chosen the remote option for taking <span class="No-Break">the exam:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer261" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.05_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.5 – Remote exam setup"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.5 – Remote exam setup</p>
			<p>The following screenshot <a id="_idIndexMarker629"/>showcases the next items you need to provide for setting up the <span class="No-Break">remote exam:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer262" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.06_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.6 – Additional information for scheduling the exam"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.6 – Additional information for scheduling the exam</p>
			<p>After you have provided the required information, you will then be taken to the exam scheduler, which shows you the available slots. Do not worry if you do not see a slot you want, if you reload the page by going through the preceding steps, there is a chance someone will have canceled and opened up a slot where you intend to take the exam. Please note that you have to cancel or reschedule your exam before you are within the 24-hour window, otherwise, you <a id="_idIndexMarker630"/>will be unable to change the time without losing your payment. In this screenshot, you can see an example of what time slots <span class="No-Break">are available:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer263" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.07_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.7 – Time slots available to book the exam"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.7 – Time slots available to book the exam</p>
			<p>I have chosen an available slot, in my case 11:15 AM. This is a 24-hour clock, so please be aware of that when setting up your exam. If you want to start your exam at 4:00 PM, you need to choose 16:00, not 4:00, as that would put your exam at 4:00 AM, and you might be in for an early phone call if you <span class="No-Break">schedule incorrectly.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, once you have chosen your slot, you will need to add a few more additional details to schedule the exam. You will need to provide a phone number, and if you have one, you can provide a <strong class="bold">Certification ID</strong>, so that it links back to your certification profile. We can see the required fields in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer264" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.08_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.8 – Scheduling the exam and agreeing to the terms and conditions"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.8 – Scheduling the exam and agreeing to the terms and conditions</p>
			<p>Once you have gone through all of these settings and agreed to the terms and conditions, your exam will <span class="No-Break">be scheduled.</span></p>
			<p>On exam day, you will need to <a id="_idIndexMarker631"/>be in a location that is free of writing with no paper or pencils around and other electronic devices than your workstation. The proctor will tell you what you can and cannot have present during the exam. You will need to place your phone away from you, and on silent, in case the exam proctor needs to contact you and cannot through the onscreen prompts. You will also have to place your ID after it is verified out of sight. You can have a beverage for the duration of the exam; however, it will be inspected by the proctor, so ensure that there is no writing on the container for the best test-taking experience. You will also be allowed to use the bathroom at an interval that the proctor will provide you. Please note that if you time your bathroom break at the 1:55 hour mark, there is a chance you will not have to perform a second room check outside of the check that occurs due to taking <span class="No-Break">a break.</span></p>
			<p>I have set up for myself a quiet little place in one of my sheds that allows privacy and full connectivity. As recommended, I have run an Ethernet cable to the shed along with a <strong class="bold">Uninterruptable Power Supply</strong> (<strong class="bold">UPS</strong>) for my laptop. I find that using the laptop screen is somewhat difficult as it is smaller than I am used to, so I recommend using a monitor you are comfortable with as you will want to maximize your space as you are only allowed one monitor. This means if you are using a laptop, it will have to remain closed while connected to the monitor, as you are not permitted to use <span class="No-Break">two monitors.</span></p>
			<p>Once you have set up a quiet place where you can safely take the exam, you should run the compatibility test within the exam environment (this image link will be emailed to you once you have scheduled your exam) to ensure that all of your equipment meets the recommended setup. If you opt to use the laptop screen with a built-in camera, ensure that it is enabled. It is much <a id="_idIndexMarker632"/>easier for the proctor to see everything and for you to be able to position the wired camera more easily if you have both of these webcams enabled. The compatibility information can be found in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer265" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.09_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.9 – Compatibility test information for a remote exam"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.9 – Compatibility test information for a remote exam</p>
			<p>After you have run the compatibility test and ensured that everything meets the requirements, you can then relax and know that you are safe to take the exam at the scheduled time and date. This will allow you to mentally prepare for the exam by not having to worry about your setup during the exam that you are <span class="No-Break">taking remotely.</span></p>
			<p>On test day, you will be able to log in using your Red Hat login and start your scheduled exam at the time you have selected. The proctor will then instruct you on what you need to do during the exam. This will allow you to understand everything that is required of you during the<a id="_idIndexMarker633"/> remote exam, thus enabling your success at taking the exam at your convenience within your <span class="No-Break">own home.</span></p>
			<p>Once that is all squared away, we will follow that setup with some tips on taking the exam itself, which will help you feel more at ease <span class="No-Break">and comfortable.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Tips and tricks that can help while taking the test</h1>
			<p>First, let’s start with<a id="_idIndexMarker634"/> something that can make your life easier right from the start. Read all of the directions from top to bottom. The reason I say this is because it can save you time if it tells you something specific that can be omitted from repetition, such as only doing things on certain servers. It will also let you know how things will be graded. By reading the directions, you will understand your test environment better and be prepared to dive head-first into the material. Anywhere you can save time is <span class="No-Break">a win.</span></p>
			<p>Speaking of time, utilize the full 4 hours for the exam. Do not try and rush it to wrap it up sooner; you are not graded on the time it takes other than that 4-hour window, which is all the time you are allotted for the exam. It will shut down your access to the exam when the timer hits 0. Do not let a question rob you of time. If you are better at other items, do those first and come back to the tougher questions if you have the time so that you can cover the <span class="No-Break">most ground.</span></p>
			<p>Another thing to keep in mind for saving time is to do everything that is not specifically called out to a specific user as root. You can always restore the SELinux contexts with a <strong class="source-inline">restorecon -Rv &lt;directory&gt;</strong> that may receive the wrong context due to the user. By using root, you will not run into issues where you might forget to use the sudo command, and being the root user directly makes finding files a breeze as you can access the entire file structure. Just be careful, as this can lead to permission issues with files and folders, so if the exam tells you to use a specific user for an action, do so. This is not best practice in everyday life but can be a time saver on <span class="No-Break">the exam.</span></p>
			<p>Next, if you are used to using the GUI interface, for instance, and the CLI isn’t as quick for you, there is something you can do to make your life easier. You can install the GUI on the servers you will be making changes to. Let’s go through how to install the GUI on a RHEL 8.1 server so that you have it up your sleeve if it is better suited <span class="No-Break">for you.</span></p>
			<p>First, we are going<a id="_idIndexMarker635"/> to install the <em class="italic">Server with GUI</em> package on the servers we would like to have the GUI on. They can be run concurrently, so you do not have to wait on one server to finish to do the next, as shown in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshots:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer266" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.10_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.10 – Installation of the Server with GUI commands"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.10 – Installation of the Server with GUI commands</p>
			<p>After you run the command to install the <em class="italic">Server with GUI</em> package, you will see the end result, as shown in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer267" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.11_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.11 – Completed install of the GUI"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.11 – Completed install of the GUI</p>
			<p>We are then going to <a id="_idIndexMarker636"/>set it so that the server boots from the graphical interface and reboots so you can access it from the console, as shown in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer268" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.12_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.12 – Commands to set the graphical interface as the default startup"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.12 – Commands to set the graphical interface as the default startup</p>
			<p>After the reboot, it should load <a id="_idIndexMarker637"/>up into the GUI, as shown in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer269" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.13_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.13 – GUI login screen for RHEL 8.1"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.13 – GUI login screen for RHEL 8.1</p>
			<p>The next thing I want you to remember<a id="_idIndexMarker638"/> is that if you get stumped, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker639"/>not only access the <strong class="bold">manual pages</strong> (<strong class="bold">man</strong>) pages, but you can also access documentation found in the <strong class="source-inline">/usr/share</strong> folder, as shown in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer270" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.14_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.14 – Folder that contains the installed package documentation"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.14 – Folder that contains the installed package documentation</p>
			<p>This directory holds information on packages that have been installed on the system. So, if you are stuck on <a id="_idIndexMarker640"/>something such as the <strong class="bold">Domain Name System</strong> (<strong class="bold">DNS</strong>) or the <strong class="bold">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">DHCP</strong>), you can look up information<a id="_idIndexMarker641"/> on the subject to get your mind rolling again. This can be extremely helpful when you feel you have forgotten everything you learned before sitting down to take <span class="No-Break">the exam.</span></p>
			<p>Now, onto man pages, which <a id="_idIndexMarker642"/>contain more detailed information on the commands and processes you can perform with the different packages you have installed. You can also do a search for items found in the man pages directory, and when you see a gzip in the <strong class="source-inline">/usr/share/man/</strong> directory, this will provide you with the name of the man page you need to access for further information. We can see a search for DHCP information in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer271" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.15_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.15 – Searching for files with DHCP in them"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.15 – Searching for files with DHCP in them</p>
			<p>You can see in the folder in<a id="_idIndexMarker643"/> the following screenshot that you have multiple man pages that contain <span class="No-Break">DHCP information:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer272" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.16_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.16 – DHCP man page names"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.16 – DHCP man page names</p>
			<p>Now, you can see that there<a id="_idIndexMarker644"/> are multiple man pages with <strong class="source-inline">dhcpd</strong> in them, and you can open a man page for further documentation, as shown in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer273" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.17_B18607.jpg" alt="Figure 10.17 – A dhcpd man page"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.17 – A dhcpd man page</p>
			<p>These gzip files help if you<a id="_idIndexMarker645"/> are stumped on the name of the man pages and need a quick way to find all of the man pages with <strong class="source-inline">dhcp</strong> in <span class="No-Break">them somewhere.</span></p>
			<p>Please note that all of your changes must be persistent when completing the exam. They will reboot all systems and wipe the Ansible nodes so that they can be utilized for running <span class="No-Break">fresh playbooks.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Finally, we are at the end of our journey through this book. I want to say thank you for choosing to go on this journey with me into the world of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It was a pleasure to write this book with the hope that I can help as many of you as possible to succeed in your goals of becoming a certified <strong class="bold">Red Hat Certified Specialist in Services Management and Automation</strong> (<strong class="bold">EX358</strong>). This exam counts toward the five additional exams needed to receive the <strong class="bold">Red Hat Certified Architect</strong> (<strong class="bold">RHCA</strong>) along with the <strong class="bold">Red Hat Certified Expert</strong> (<strong class="bold">RHCE</strong>) exam. I hope you gained some insights into how I accomplish tasks. However, it’s important you know that these are not the only ways you can complete these tasks to accomplish your certification goals, but some of the many that will hopefully spur you on to the path <span class="No-Break">of victory.</span></p>
