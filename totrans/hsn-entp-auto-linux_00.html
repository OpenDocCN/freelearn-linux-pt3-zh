<p class="mce-root">Welcome to <em>Hands-On Enterprise Automation on Linux</em>, your guide to a collection of the most valuable processes, methodologies, and tools for streamlining and efficiently managing your Linux deployments at enterprise scale. This book will provide you with the knowledge and skills required to standardize your Linux estate and manage it at scale, using open source tools including Ansible, AWX (Ansible Tower), Pulp, Katello, and OpenSCAP. You will learn about the creation of standard operating environments, and how to define, document, manage, and maintain these standards using Ansible. In addition, you will acquire knowledge of security hardening standards, such as the CIS Benchmarks. Throughout the book, practical, hands-on examples will be provided for you to try for yourself, on which you can build your own code, and to demonstrate the principles being covered.</p>

<p>This book is for anyone who has a Linux environment to design, implement, and care for. It is intended to appeal to a wide range of open source professionals, from infrastructure architects through to system administrators, including professionals up to C level. Proficiency in the implementation and maintenance of Linux servers and familiarity with the concepts involved in building, patching, and maintaining a Linux server infrastructure are assumed. Prior knowledge of Ansible and other automation tools is not essential but may be beneficial.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">To get the most out of this book</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>To follow the examples in this book, it is recommended that you have access to at least two Linux machines for testing on, though more may be preferable to develop the examples more fully. These can be either physical or virtual machines—all examples were developed on a set of Linux virtual machines, but should work just as well on physical ones. In <a href="3802fb48-9f14-4a52-98c5-280d381260a4.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Using Ansible to Build Virtual Machine Templates for Deployment</em>, we make use of nested virtualization on a KVM virtual machine to build a Linux image. The exact hardware requirements for this are listed at the beginning of this chapter. This will require either access to a physical machine with the appropriate CPU to run the examples on, or a hypervisor that supports nested virtualization (for example, VMware or Linux KVM).</p>
<p>Please be aware that some examples in this book could be disruptive to other services on your network; where there is such a risk, this is highlighted at the beginning of each chapter. I recommend you try out the examples in an isolated test network unless/until you are confident that they will not have any impact on your operations.</p>
<p>Although other Linux distributions are mentioned in the book, we focus on two key Linux distributions—CentOS 7.6 (though if you have access to it, you are welcome to use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6, which should work just as well in most examples), and Ubuntu Server 18.04. All test machines were built from the official ISO images, using the minimal installation profile.</p>
<p>As such, where additional software is required, we take you through the steps needed to install it so that you can complete the examples. If you choose to complete all the examples, you will install software such as AWX, Pulp, Katello, and OpenSCAP. The only exception to this is FreeIPA, which is mentioned in <a href="c0f8fc80-0786-4ada-a033-e14e38d989ff.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Managing Users on Linux</em>. Installing a directory server for your enterprise is a huge topic that sadly requires more space than we have in this book—hence, you may wish to explore this topic independently.</p>
<p>The text assumes that you will run Ansible from one of your Linux test machines, but Ansible can actually be run on any machine with Python 2.7 or Python 3 (versions 3.5 and higher) installed (Windows is supported for the control machine, but only through a Linux distribution running in the <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (<strong>WSL</strong>) layer available on newer versions of Windows. Supported operating systems for Ansible include (but are not limited to) Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, macOS, and FreeBSD.</p>
<p>This book uses the Ansible 2.8.x.x series release, although a few examples are specific to Ansible 2.9.x.x, which was released during the course of writing. Ansible installation instructions can be found at <a href="https:/%E2%80%8B/%E2%80%8Bdocs.%E2%80%8Bansible.%E2%80%8Bcom/%E2%80%8Bansible/%E2%80%8Bintro_%E2%80%8Binstallation.%E2%80%8Bhtml">https:/​/​docs.​ansible.​com/​ansible/​intro_​installation.​html</a>.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>:<span> </span><span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles.<span> </span><span>Here is an example:</span><span> </span>"<span>To start with, let's create a role called </span><kbd>loadmariadb</kbd>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>- name: Ensure PostgreSQL service is installed and started at boot time<br/>  service:<br/>    name: postgresql<br/>    state: started<br/>    enabled: yes</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ mkdir /var/lib/tftpboot/EFIx64/centos7</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
