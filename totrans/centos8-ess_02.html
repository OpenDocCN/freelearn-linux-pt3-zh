			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">There are now two ways in which a CentOS 8 system can be deployed. One method is to either purchase new hardware or re-purpose an existing computer system on which to install and run the operating system. Another option is to create a cloud-based operating system instance using services such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure (to name but a few). Since cloud-based instances are typically created by selecting a pre-configured, ready to run operating system image that is already optimized for the cloud platform, and using that as the basis for the CentOS system, there is no need to perform a manual operating system installation in this situation. </p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">If, on the other hand, you plan to install CentOS 8 on your own hardware, the first step on the path to learning about CentOS 8 involves installing the operating system.</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">CentOS can be installed either in a clean disk environment (where an entire disk is cleared of any existing partitions and dedicated entirely to CentOS) or in a dual boot environment where CentOS co-exists with another operating system on the disk (typically a member of the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems). </p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">In this chapter we will be covering the clean disk approach to installation from local or remote installation media. Dual boot installation with a Windows 10 system will be covered in <a href="../Text/Installation_Dual_Boot.xhtml#_idTextAnchor046"><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">“Dual Booting CentOS 8 with Windows”</span></a>.</p>&#13;
			<p id="_idParaDest-16" class="Heading-1-1"><span class="Heading11Marker">3.1 </span><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Obtaining the CentOS Installation Media</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">The CentOS distribution can be downloaded from the CentOS Project website using the following URL:</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph"><a href="https://www.centos.org/download/"><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">https://www.centos.org/download/</span></a></p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">The installation media is provided in the form of a DVD ISO image and is available in the following forms:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Bullet-List"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-3">•</span><span class="My-Bold CharOverride-1">CentOS Linux DVD ISO</span> - Contains the installation image for the version of CentOS built from the RHEL 8 source code.</p>&#13;
			<p class="Bullet-List"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-3">•</span><span class="My-Bold CharOverride-1">CentOS Stream DVD ISO</span> - Contains a continuously evolving version of CentOS that will eventually become the next versions of RHEL and CentOS.</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">For the purposes of this book, download the <span class="My-Italic CharOverride-1">CentOS Linux DVD ISO</span> image. The DVD ISO image is self-contained including all of the packages necessary to install a CentOS system and is named using the following convention:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">CentOS-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;architecture&gt;-dvd.iso</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">For example, the CentOS 8 DVD image for 64-bit Intel systems is named as follows:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">CentOS-8-x86_64-1905-dvd1.iso</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Having downloaded the image, either burn it to disk or use the steps in the next section to write the media to a USB drive, configure your virtualization environment to treat it as a DVD drive or use the steps outlined later in this chapter to access the installation image over a network connection.</p>&#13;

			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">These days it is more likely that an operating system installation will be performed from a USB drive than from a DVD. Having downloaded the ISO installation image for CentOS 8, the steps to write that image to a USB drive will differ depending on whether the drive is attached to a Linux, macOS or Windows system. The steps outlined in the remainder of this section assume that the USB drive is new, or has been reformatted to remove any existing data or partitions:</p>&#13;
			<p id="_idParaDest-18" class="Heading-1-1-1"><span class="Heading111Marker">3.2.1 </span><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Linux</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">The first step in writing an ISO image to a <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>USB drive on Linux is to identify the device name. Before inserting the USB drive, identify the <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>storage devices already detected on the system by listing the devices in <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">/dev</span> as follows:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># ls /dev/sd*</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">/dev/sda  /dev/sda1  /dev/sda2</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Attach the USB drive to the Linux system and run the <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">dmesg</span> command to get a list of recent system messages, one of which will be a report that the USB drive was detected and will be similar to the following:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">[445597.988045] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">This output tells us that we should expect the device name to include “sdb” which we can confirm by listing device names in <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">/dev</span> again:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># ls /dev/sd*</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">/dev/sda   /dev/sda1   /dev/sda2   /dev/sdb</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">From this output we can tell that the USB drive has been assigned to /dev/sdb. The next step before writing the ISO image to the device is to run the <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">findmnt</span> command to make sure it has not been auto-mounted:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># findmnt /dev/sdb</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">TARGET                                           SOURCE   FSTYPE OPTIONS</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">/run/media/neil/d6bf9574-7e31-4f54-88b1          /dev/sdb ext3   rw,nosuid,no</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">If the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">findmnt</span> command indicates that the USB drive has been mounted, unmount it before continuing:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"><a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>umount /run/media/neil/d6bf9574-7e31-4f54-88b1</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Once the filesystem has been unmounted, use the <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">dd</span> command as follows to write the ISO image to the drive:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># dd if=/path/to/iso/image.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=512k</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">The writing process can take some time (as long as 10 - 15 minutes) to complete depending on the image size and speed of the system on which it is running. Once the image has been written, output similar to the following will appear and the USB drive is ready to be used to install CentOS 8:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">5956+0 records in</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">5956+0 records out</p>&#13;

			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">The first step in writing an ISO image to a USB drive attached to a macOS system is to identify the device using the <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">diskutil</span> tool.

			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">The manual partitioning screen provides the option to configure the disk using <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>Logical Volume Management (<a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>LVM) or standard partitioning. LVM is the recommended option because it provides flexibility in terms of managing partition sizes once the system is up and running (LVM is covered in detail in the chapter entitled <a href="../Text/Volume_Groups.xhtml#_idTextAnchor375"><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">“Adding a New Disk to a CentOS 8 Volume Group and Logical Volume”</span></a><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">).</span></p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Once a partitioning scheme has been selected, the last step is to decide on the sizes of the partitions and the corresponding filesystem mount points. In general, the default configuration provided by the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">Click here to create them automatically</span> option will meet most system needs. To manually create partitions and allocate mount points, click on the + button to declare and assign each partition manually.</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Another option is to select automatic partition creation, and then use the resulting screen to manually change the partition configuration as needed. <a href="../Text/Installation_Clean_Disk.xhtml#_idTextAnchor034">Figure 3-13</a>, for example, shows the partition configuration defined by selecting the automatic creation option and allows the settings for each partition to be modified before any changes are made to the disk:</p>&#13;

			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">As with most operating systems today, each particular release of a CentOS distribution continues to evolve after it has been released to the public. This generally takes the form of bug fixes and security updates and, occasionally, new features that may be downloaded over the internet and installed on your system.</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Best practices dictate that the first step after installing CentOS is to make sure any available updates are applied to the system. This can be achieved via the command-line prompt in a Terminal window using the <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">dnf</span> package manager tool. To check for the availability of updates, simply run the following command:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># dnf check-update</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Any pending updates may be applied, once again using the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">dnf</span> tool:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># dnf update</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Upon execution, the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">dnf</span> tool will provide a list of packages that are available for update and prompt for permission to perform the update.</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Once the update is complete the installation is essentially finished and CentOS 8 is ready for use.</p>&#13;
			<p id="_idParaDest-26" class="Heading-1-1"><span class="Heading11Marker">3.8 </span><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Displaying Boot Messages</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">During the boot process, CentOS 8 will display the Red Hat Graphical Boot (RHGB) screen which hides from view all of the boot messages generated by the system as it loads. To make these messages visible during the boot process (as shown in <a href="../Text/Installation_Clean_Disk.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044">Figure 3-17</a>), simply press the keyboard Esc key while the system is starting:</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-17" src="Images/centos_8_boot_messages.png" alt="" width="1243" height="691"/></p>&#13;
			<p class="Figure-Caption"><span class="FigureCaptionMarker">Figure 3-17</span><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/></p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">The default behavior can be changed so that messages are always displayed by default by editing the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">/etc/default/grub</span> file and changing the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX setting which, by default, will read as follows:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="crashkernel=auto rhgb quiet"</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">To remove the graphical boot screen so that messages are visible without pressing the Esc key, remove the “rhgb” option from the setting:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="crashkernel=auto <span class="My-Strikethrough">rhgb</span> quiet"</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">This change will cause the system to display only a subset of the boot messages generated by the system. To display all messages generated by the system, also remove the “quiet” option:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="crashkernel=auto <span class="My-Strikethrough">quiet</span>"</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Once the changes have been made, run the following command to generate a new boot configuration to take effect next time the system starts:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># grub2-mkconfig --output=/boot/grub2/grub.cfg</p>&#13;
			<p id="_idParaDest-27" class="Heading-1-1"><span class="Heading11Marker">3.9 </span><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Summary</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">The first step in working with CentOS 8 is to install the operating system. In the case of a cloud-based server, this task is typically performed automatically when an operating system image is selected for the system based on a range of options offered by the cloud service provider. Installation on your own hardware, however, involves downloading the installation media in the form of an ISO image, writing that image to suitable storage such as a DVD or USB drive and booting from it. Once running, the installation process allows a range of options to be configured ranging from networking, whether the installation should proceed from the local media or via a remote server or repository, the packages to be installed, and the partitioning of the disk. Once installation is complete, it is important to install any operating system updates that may have been released since the original installation image was created. </p>&#13;
