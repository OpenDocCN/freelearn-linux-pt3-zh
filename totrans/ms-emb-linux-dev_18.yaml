- en: This part will help you with the implementation phase of the project. We will
    start with Python packaging and dependency management, a topic of growing importance
    as machine learning applications continue to take the world by storm. [*Chapter
    16*](Chapter_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor030) is a new chapter on DevOps that explains
    how to continuously build and deploy Python applications inside containers with
    Docker. Next, we will move on to various forms of inter-process communication
    and multithreaded programming. The section concludes with a careful examination
    of how Linux manages memory and demonstrates how to measure memory usage and detect
    memory leaks using the various tools that are available.
