- en: The major benefit of open source operating systems such as Linux is that anyone
    can dig deep and uncover how they work under the hood. Even with the astronomical
    advances in software development, the Linux kernel remains one of the most complex
    pieces of code. Developers, programmers, and would-be kernel hackers are constantly
    diving into the kernel code and are pushing for new features. Hobbyists and enthusiasts
    like me are trying to understand and unravel mysteries.

- en: As one of those enthusiasts, I have spent quite some time exploring the intricacies
    of the Linux storage stack. From simple hard drives to complex networked storage
    systems, Linux is at the heart of many of the world’s most complex storage technologies.
    Over the last few years, I’ve had a chance to work on Linux and several storage
    technologies, which piqued my interest in this area. This book is the result of
    that exploration. I’ve tried peeling off all the layers of the Linux storage stack
    to show how they all work in unison. My goal is to share what I have learned with
    others who share my fascination with this topic.

    stack. It covers all of the major components of the stack and includes an in-depth
    and detailed analysis of the storage subsystem and its architecture, the virtual
    filesystem layer, different filesystems and the differences in their implementations,
    the block layer, multi-queue and device mapper frameworks, scheduling, and physical
    layers. It also covers a variety of topics relating to storage performance analysis,
    tuning, and troubleshooting.

    engineers, Linux professionals, the Linux community in general, and anyone who
    wants to widen their understanding of Linux. When working in any environment,
    it is imperative to have a deep understanding of the technology that you’re working
    on. I believe this book will give you a better understanding of Linux internals,
    equip you with the necessary knowledge, and increase your general interest in
    the subject.

    – The Virtual Filesystem*, provides an introduction to the **virtual filesystem**
    (**VFS**) in the Linux kernel. The chapter will explain the pivotal role of the
    VFS in the I/O stack and provide a strong conceptual understanding of VFS as it
    is the starting point of an I/O request in Linux.'

    in a VFS*, introduces the various data structures utilized by the VFS in the kernel.
    The usage of structures by the kernel such as inodes, directory entries, and file
    objects to store file metadata, directories, and open files will be explained.
    Furthermore, the method by which the superblock structure enables the kernel to
    record filesystem characteristics will also be covered. Finally, the page caching
    mechanism in the kernel will be explained.'

    Under the VFS*, introduces the concept of filesystems in Linux. One of the most
    popular block-based filesystems in Linux, the extended filesystem, will be explained.
    Additionally, important filesystem concepts such as journaling and copy-on-write
    will be discussed in detail. The chapter will also delve into the differences
    between file and block I/O and explore the network filesystem. Finally, the concept
    of userspace filesystems will be introduced.'
