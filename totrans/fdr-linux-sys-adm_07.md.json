["```\n[root@workstation ~]# cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n/etc/sysctl.conf file by adding a lower value to this parameter. As a recommendation, add a comment of the change made as a backup:\n\n```", "```\n\n After saving the file, reboot the computer and confirm the changed value. With this, less information should write to the virtual drive.\nWith this basic tuning done, let’s get a better experience with the use of our desktop resources. So now, let’s go ahead and customize it to have the tools at hand and perform better day-to-day activities.\nTuning the desktop experience\nIn the GNOME desktop, in the upper-left corner, you will find the **Activities** menu button. By clicking it, access to the programs and system settings is available. Pressing the *Super* key also opens the **Activities** menu.\nFrom the **Activities** menu, we can search for any program, but GNOME can not only search for software but also for any item that is available, such as locations, contacts, calendar appointments, notes, and so on.\n![Figure 3.1 – Searching from the Activities menu](img/3.1.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.1 – Searching from the Activities menu\nThis is very useful, but it can also mean a resource drain on the performance of the desktop environment. To limit GNOME’s search, click on the icons at the top right and click on the gear to open the configuration window. In the **Search** section, select only the source of the items to search for.\n![Figure 3.2 – Settings – Search](img/B19121_03_002.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.2 – Settings – Search\nWhen a file search is enabled, a background program runs to read filenames and generate an index of them. This service runs often to detect new files as they are created. So, disabling file indexing can free up resources.\n![Figure 3.3 – Settings – Files disabled](img/B19121_03_003.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.3 – Settings – Files disabled\nNote\nFile indexing in GNOME comes from a service called **tracker**, which can be completely uninstalled to ensure that it does not run in the background. To uninstall it, run the **dnf** **remove** command:\n**[root@workstation ~]# dnf** **remove tracker**\nMore tuning exists under GNOME, but the `dnf` command:\n\n```", "```\n\n Let’s now take a look at some of the tunings available with the tool.\nGNOME Tweak Tool\nGNOME Tweak Tool is a new application that contains a variety of customization options beyond what’s available in the system settings ([https://wiki.gnome.org/Gnome3CheatSheet](https://wiki.gnome.org/Gnome3CheatSheet)).\n![Figure 3.4 – GNOME Tweaks](img/B19121_03_004.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.4 – GNOME Tweaks\nThese tunings change the behavior or use of different desktop elements, such as the following:\n\n*   **Appearance**\n*   **Fonts**\n*   **Keyboard &** **Mouse**\n*   **Startup Applications**\n*   **Top Bar**\n*   **Window Titlebars**\n*   **Windows**\n\nA very useful tuning when our workstation is not portable is to disable the **suspension** of the computer when the lid closes. To disable this behavior, turn off the **Suspend when laptop lid is closed** switch in the **General** section of **Tweaks**.\n![Figure 3.5 – GNOME Tweaks – General](img/B19121_03_005.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.5 – GNOME Tweaks – General\nNote\nSuspension is useful when moving around because it *saves* battery power. Please consider whether this option is useful for your day-to-day tasks.\nAnother tuning we should keep an eye on is the **system startup** applications, which are set in the **Startup Applications** section of **Tweaks**.\n![Figure 3.6 – GNOME Tweaks – Startup Applications](img/B19121_03_006.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.6 – GNOME Tweaks – Startup Applications\nTo add a startup application, click on the plus sign (**+**) and add the program.\n![Figure 3.7 – GNOME Tweaks – Adding Startup Applications](img/B19121_03_007.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.7 – GNOME Tweaks – Adding Startup Applications\nThese tunings are the basic ones to optimize the performance of the desktop environment in our workstation. Now, let’s see some customizations to improve the user experience.\nGNOME Shell extensions\nThese customizations come through the available GNOME desktop extensions. In the same way as with Chrome and Firefox browser extensions, **GNOME Shell extensions** enable small changes and modify the way GNOME works.\nGNOME shell extensions can be installed with the `dnf install` command, and also from the browser, as follows:\n\n1.  Open the URL [https://extensions.gnome.org/](https://extensions.gnome.org/) in the Firefox web browser.\n\n![Figure 3.8 – GNOME Shell extensions](img/3.8.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.8 – GNOME Shell extensions\n\n1.  Click on the **Click here to install browser extension** link to install the browser extension, add the **GNOME Shell integration** extension, and accept the installation.\n\n![Figure 3.9 – GNOME Shell integration extension installed](img/3.9.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.9 – GNOME Shell integration extension installed\n\n1.  Once the installation is complete, the GNOME icon appears in the browser bar.\n\n![Figure 3.10 – GNOME icon in the browser bar](img/B19121_03_010.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.10 – GNOME icon in the browser bar\n\n1.  Press the *F5* key to refresh the page and install the extensions.\n\n![Figure 3.11 – GNOME Extensions page](img/3.11.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.11 – GNOME Extensions page\nNow, let’s go over how to customize each component of our desktop environment, starting with the panel and the taskbar.\nCustomizing the panel and the taskbar\nOne of the functionalities that everybody misses in the desktop environment is having a menu that allows organized access to applications.\nIn the GNOME extensions, there are different menu options that help with this need.\nIn my case, I like to use the **ArcMenu extension**, as it provides a clean and clear organization of applications, and it adds some shortcuts to directories and system settings.\nIn the search bar, type `ArcMenu`, then click on the extension name, and toggle the switch to **ON** on the extension page ([https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3628/arcmenu/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3628/arcmenu/)). Click on the **Install** button.\n![Figure 3.12 – ArcMenu extension installation](img/B19121_03_012.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.12 – ArcMenu extension installation\nThe **ArcMenu** icon appears in the upper-left corner instead of the **Activities** menu. Click on it, and the menu opens.\n![Figure 3.13 – ArcMenu extension](img/B19121_03_013.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.13 – ArcMenu extension\nClick on the ArcMenu **Settings** button to change the appearance and organization of the applications, as well as to add or remove shortcuts.\n![Figure 3.14 – ArcMenu settings](img/B19121_03_014.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.14 – ArcMenu settings\nInstead of the *ArcMenu* icon, I prefer the *Fedora* icon to be shown. To do this, click on the **Menu Button** tab and click on the **Browse** button in the **Choose a new icon** section. Then, in the **Distro Icons** tab, choose the **Fedora** icon.\n![Figure 3.15 – Choosing the Fedora icon](img/B19121_03_015.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.15 – Choosing the Fedora icon\nClose the window, and now the Fedora icon shows up as the menu in the top-left corner.\n![Figure 3.16 – ArcMenu with the Fedora icon](img/B19121_03_016.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.16 – ArcMenu with the Fedora icon\nThe extension installation procedure is the same in all cases. Let’s now look at the extensions that will help us to improve the taskbar.\nThe taskbar\nIn the taskbar, the best practices include shortcuts to the most used applications, as well as to the general information and system settings.\nOn the left side, next to the menu, add the **Frippery Panel Favorites** extension ([https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4/panel-favorites/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4/panel-favorites/)).\n![Figure 3.17 – Frippery Panel Favorites](img/B19121_03_017.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.17 – Frippery Panel Favorites\nTo add or remove favorites, from the menu, click on the **Activities Overview** icon and drag and drop the application icons to the bottom bar.\n![Figure 3.18 – Favorites applications](img/3.18.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.18 – Favorites applications\nTo have local weather information, add the **OpenWeather** extension ([https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/750/openweather/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/750/openweather/)) next to the clock in the center of the taskbar.\n![Figure 3.19 – OpenWeather extension](img/B19121_03_019.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.19 – OpenWeather extension\nTo change the location, click on the *settings icon* button in the lower-right corner, and in the **Locations** tab of the **Settings** window, click on the **Add** button to find the location and add it.\n![Figure 3.20 – OpenWeather Settings](img/B19121_03_020.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.20 – OpenWeather Settings\nThe extensions that I recommend for the upper-right corner are as follows:\n\n*   **Clipboard Indicator** – Saves the text copied for reuse:\n\n[https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/779/clipboard-indicator/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/779/clipboard-indicator/)\n\n*   **Extension List** – Provides access to the extension’s configuration:\n\n[https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3088/extension-list/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3088/extension-list/)\n\n*   **Hide Keyboard Layout** – Hides the keyboard layout configuration:\n\n[https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2848/hide-keyboard-layout/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2848/hide-keyboard-layout/)\n\n*   **Section Todo List** – Adds a simple to-do list:\n\n[https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1104/section-todo-list/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1104/section-todo-list/)\n\n*   **Removable Drive Menu** – When inserting a removable disk, it adds a quick access to unmount it:\n\n[https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7/removable-drive-menu/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7/removable-drive-menu/)\nIn the case of a portable computer, the **Battery Time** extension ([https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5425/battery-time/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5425/battery-time/)) indicates the remaining charge time.\n![Figure 3.21 – Taskbar – Upper-right corner](img/B19121_03_021.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.21 – Taskbar – Upper-right corner\nOther extensions that help improve the look and feel of the desktop environment are as follows:\n\n*   **User Avatar In Quick Settings** – Displays the user’s profile picture in the **Settings** part of the upper-right corner:\n\n[https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5506/user-avatar-in-quick-settings/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5506/user-avatar-in-quick-settings/)\n\n*   **Transparent Shell** – Makes desktop components (top bar, dash, workspace view, etc.) transparent:\n\n[https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3518/transparent-shell/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3518/transparent-shell/)\n![Figure 3.22 – Customized taskbar](img/3.22.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.22 – Customized taskbar\nFedora provides an extension that displays the distribution logo on the desktop wallpaper. You can install the `gnome-shell-extension-background-logo` package using the following `dnf` command:\n\n```", "```\n\n Click on the **Extensions List** icon in the upper-right corner, then click on the *gear* icon next to the **Background Logo** extension to customize how the Fedora logo is displayed.\n![Figure 3.23 – Background Logo settings](img/B19121_03_023.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.23 – Background Logo settings\nAnother thing that also improves the look and feel of the desktop environment is the **wallpaper**. One recommendation is to use a neutral background that does not distract our attention. On the [https://pixabay.com/](https://pixabay.com/) page, you can find some free-usage minimalist images to use as a wallpaper.\nTo change the wallpaper, right-click on the desktop background and select **Change background**, then in the **Appearance** section of the **Settings** window, click on the **+ Add Picture** button to add the downloaded image and apply the change.\n![Figure 3.24 – Appearance settings](img/B19121_03_024.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.24 – Appearance settings\nNow, our custom desktop environment looks and feels better.\n![Figure 3.25 – Customized desktop](img/B19121_03_025.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.25 – Customized desktop\nOur desktop environment looks pretty good, but we could improve it even more with other elements. Let’s see how to do that next.\nMaking tasks easy with widgets\n**Widgets** are small applications designed to ease access or provide information on the desktop.\nA to-do list shows a simple list of tasks to do, but if you need more details about the tasks or their development, you can use the GNOME **Task Widget** extension ([https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3569/task-widget/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3569/task-widget/)).\n![Figure 3.26 – Task widget extension](img/3.26.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.26 – Task widget extension\nThe **Task Widget** extension displays tasks near the Calendar widget, providing easy access to the task list along with the ability to merge task lists, group them by due date, mark them as completed for historical record, plus integrate with mail application calendars.\nIn Linux, widgets are generally used to provide computer performance information. There are various extensions that can be used to present information in the taskbar:\n\n*   **Resource Monitor** – Displays CPU, memory, storage and network usage:\n\n[https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1634/resource-monitor/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1634/resource-monitor/)\n![Figure 3.27 – Resource Monitor extension](img/B19121_03_027.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.27 – Resource Monitor extension\n\n*   **System Monitor** – Shows the use of resources by icons that change color according to their use. By default, it is placed in the center of the taskbar, but its location could be customized:\n\n[https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1064/system-monitor/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1064/system-monitor/)\n![Figure 3.28 – System Monitor extension](img/B19121_03_028.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.28 – System Monitor extension\n\n*   **TopHat** – Displays CPU, memory, and network usage in a small graph:\n\n[https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5219/tophat/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5219/tophat/)\n![Figure 3.29 – TopHat extension](img/B19121_03_029.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.29 – TopHat extension\n\n*   **Vitals** – Displays a summary of CPU, memory, and network usage via icons, but clicking on the extension displays all monitored resources:\n\n[https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1460/vitals/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1460/vitals/)\n![Figure 3.30 – Vitals extension](img/B19121_03_030.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.30 – Vitals extension\nI do not use these extensions, as they somehow take away space from the taskbar and, in some cases, the taskbar looks like it has collapsed with so much information. In my case, I prefer an option that keeps my taskbar cleaner and displays all the system information I need on the desktop.\nConky\n**Conky** ([https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky)) is a lightweight system monitor, created for the *X Window System*. It displays any kind of information on the desktop.\nYou can install Conky using the following `dnf` command:\n\n```", "```\n\n You can browse the internet to find a lot of templates with different designs that could apply to Conky. I like to use those posted at [https://www.deviantart.com/](https://www.deviantart.com/).\n![Figure 3.31 – Conky designs at deviantart.com](img/3.31.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.31 – Conky designs at deviantart.com\nI found my favorite Conky template, `conky_harmattan`, in a Deviant Art post ([https://github.com/zagortenay333/conky_themes/tree/master/conky_harmattan](https://github.com/zagortenay333/conky_themes/tree/master/conky_harmattan)). It has many themes included, but we’ll use the `conky_themes` repository in the user’s home directory to install it:\n\n```", "```\n\n Note\nWe’ll talk a bit more about Git in a later chapter.\nChange to the `conky_harmattan` directory inside the `conky_themes` directory:\n\n```", "```\n[acallejas@workstation conky_harmattan]$ cp -r .harmattan-assets ~/\n[acallejas@workstation conky_harmattan]$ cp -r .harmattan-themes ~/\n```", "```\n[acallejas@workstation ~]$ vi .config/autostart/start_conky.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=/bin/sh -c \"$HOME/.config/autostart/start_conky.sh\"\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nTerminal=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName=Conky\nGenericName=ConkyStartup\nconky startup script as ~/.config/autostart/start_conky.sh with the following content:\n\n```", "```\n[acallejas@workstation ~]$ chmod +x .config/autostart/start_conky.sh\n```", "```\n[acallejas@workstation ~]$ vi .harmattan-themes/Glass/God-Mode/.conkyrc\n...output omitted...\n-------------------------------------\n--  API Key\n-------------------------------------\ntemplate6=\"d60bb6c3b2b806caf46c43...\",\n-------------------------------------\n--  City ID\n-------------------------------------\ntemplate7=\"3530597\",\n...output omitted...\n```", "```\nconky displays on the desktop:\n![Figure 3.33 – Conky on the desktop](img/3.33.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.33 – Conky on the desktop\nTo customize the `conky` location, edit the `~/.harmattan-themes/Glass/God-Mode/.conkyrc` file in the `Windows Specifications` section by changing the `gap_x` and `gap_y` values, depending on the screen resolution:\n\n```", "```\n\n Saving the file displays the change in Conky’s position:\n![Figure 3.34 – Conky monitor](img/3.34.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.34 – Conky monitor\nTo see the transparent window, uncomment the following lines from the `Windows Specifications` section of the `~/.``harmattan-themes/Glass/God-Mode/.conkyrc` file:\n\n```", "```\n\n ![Figure 3.35 – Conky with transparent window](img/3.35.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.35 – Conky with transparent window\nTo fix the network graph, check that the device name is correct in the `conky.text` section of the `~/.``harmattan-themes/Glass/God-Mode/.conkyrc` file:\n\n```", "```\n\n Saving the file displays the graphs in Conky:\n![Figure 3.36 – Conky graphs](img/3.36.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.36 – Conky graphs\nGNOME extensions include many extra ways of customization. A very popular element is **docks**. Let’s see some of these options in the following section.\nHandy applications with docks\n**Launchers** or **docks** are a convenient way to access favorite and used applications. GNOME does not provide a dock, but you could get one through GNOME extensions.\nThe most popular are as follows:\n\n*   **Dash to Dock** – Provides the classic dock with favorite applications. The dock location could change in the extension settings:\n\n[https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/)\n![Figure 3.37 – Dash to Dock extension](img/B19121_03_037.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.37 – Dash to Dock extension\n\n*   **Floating Dock** – Provides a dock with a button, which, when pressed, displays favorite applications. The location of the dock could change in the extension settings:\n\n[https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2542/floating-dock/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2542/floating-dock/)\n![Figure 3.38 – Floating Dock extension](img/B19121_03_038.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.38 – Floating Dock extension\nThis customization provides us with a clean desktop for our day-to-day tasks.\nThese customizations, of course, are not the only ones that exist. A `fedy` ([https://github.com/rpmfusion-infra/fedy](https://github.com/rpmfusion-infra/fedy)), which let us add codecs and third-party or proprietary software from a graphical interface.\nImportant\n**RPM Fusion** is a set of repositories that are not affiliated with or supported by the **Fedora Project**. For more information, refer to *Enabling the RPM Fusion repositories* in the Fedora documentation at [https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/setup_rpmfusion/](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/setup_rpmfusion/).\nBefore discussing the functionality of the applications involved, the following chapters provide a brief overview of the basic concepts of storage and networking that are needed for later use.\nSummary\nThis chapter offered an overview of desktop environment customization, from resource tuning to tools and tips for a clean and minimalistic desktop.\nWe divided it into tuning and customization. Keeping that in mind, we customized only the taskbar and its components, as well as added the `conky` system monitor.\nCustomizing each of the elements of the desktop environment, besides improving the way it looks and feels, allows us to focus on our tasks. It is well known in Linux-based environments, which provide extreme customization of each component, that this task could be endless.\nIn my experience as a system administrator, not getting distracted by this kind of customization helps me to focus on my daily work.\nIn the next chapter, we will review the concepts of basic local storage, as well as how to optimize its use.\nFurther reading\nTo learn more about the topics that were covered in this chapter, take a look at the following resources:\n\n*   *What Is Swappiness on Linux?
