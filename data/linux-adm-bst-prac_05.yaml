    *durability*. Storage is where we have the smallest margin of error as well as
    where we can make the biggest impact. In other areas of planning and design we
    often get the benefit of quite a bit of *fudge factor*, mistakes are often graceful
    such as a system that is not quite as fast as it needs to be or is somewhat more
    costly than necessary, but in storage overbuilding might double total costs and
    mistakes will quite easily result in non-functional systems. Failure tends to
    be anything but graceful.

    believe me it happens, and it happens often. As a rule, IT is a business function
    and all businesses, by definition, are about making money, and the cost of providing
    an infrastructure need always must factor in profits. So, because of this, no
    decision in IT (or anywhere in a business) should happen without cost as a consideration.
    We should never allow cost to be forgotten, or just as bad allowing someone to
    state that *cost is no object* because that can never be true and makes absolutely

- en: Storage is generally one of the costliest components of a production system
    so we tend to see costs be more sensitive when dealing with storage than when
    dealing with other parts of physical system design such as CPU and RAM. Storage
    is also often easiest to solve by simply throwing more money at it and so many
    people when planning for hardware err on the side of overbuilding because it is
    easy. Of course, we can always do this and as long as we understand enough of
    our storage needs and how storage works it will *work* outside of being overly
    expensive. But, of course, it is difficult to be effective system administrators

    trumps all else. It is very rare that we want to store something that we cannot

- en: Durability also refers to data that resists corruption or decay. In storage
    we have to worry about the potential of a portion of our data set losing integrity
    which may or may not be something that we can detect. Just because we can retrieve
    data alone does not tell us that the data that we are retrieving is exactly what
    it is supposed to be. Data corruption can mean a file that we can no longer read,
    a database that we can no longer access, an operating system that no longer boots,
    or worse, it can even mean a number in an accounting application changing to a
    different, but valid, number which is all but impossible to detect.

  zh: 耐用性还指的是数据能够抵抗损坏或衰退。在存储中，我们必须担心数据集的某些部分可能会失去完整性，而这可能是我们能够或无法检测到的。仅仅因为我们能检索到数据，并不能告诉我们我们所检索的数据是否完全符合预期。数据损坏可能意味着文件无法读取，数据库无法访问，操作系统无法启动，甚至更糟糕，它可能意味着会计应用中的一个数字变成了另一个不同但有效的数字，而这种变化几乎不可能被检测到。

    our data was when it came time to retrieve it. Availability is often referred
    to as *uptime* and if your storage is not available, neither is your workload.
    So, while availability generally takes a back seat to durability, it is still
    extremely important and one of the two key aspects of overall storage reliability.

  zh: 传统上，我们主要从数据可用性的角度考虑数据的可靠性，尤其是在检索数据时。可用性通常被称为*正常运行时间*，如果存储不可用，那么你的工作负载也无法使用。因此，尽管可用性通常会让位于耐用性，但它仍然极为重要，是整体存储可靠性的两个关键方面之一。
- en: There are times when availability and performance become intertwined. There
    can be situations where storage performance drops so significantly that data becomes
    effectively unavailable. Consider a shower that just drips every few seconds,
    technically there is still water, but it is not coming through the pipes fast
    enough to be able to use it.

- en: We will be talking about RAID in depth in just a little bit, but availability
    and performance are good real-world examples. A famous situation can arise with
    large RAID 6 arrays when a drive or two have failed and have been replaced and
    the array is online and in the process of actively rebuilding (a process by which
    missing data is recalculated from metadata.) It is quite common for the RAID system
    to be overwhelmed due to the amount of data being processed and written that the
    resulting array, while technically online and available, is so slow that it cannot
    be used in any meaningful way and operating systems or applications attempting
    to use it will not just be useless from the extreme slowness but may even error
    out reporting that the storage is offline due to the overly long response times.
    *Available* can become a murky concept if we are not careful.

- en: Performance can be difficult to measure as there are many ways of looking at
    it, and different types of storage media tend to have very different performance
    characteristics. There are concepts such as latency (time before data retrieval
    begins), throughput (also known as *bandwidth*, measuring the rate at which data
    can be streamed), and input/output operations per second or IOPS (the number of
    storage related activities that can be performed in each amount of time.) Most

- en: 'It is always tempting to reduce factors to something simple to understand and
    compare. But if we think about cars, we could compare three vehicles: one with
    a fast acceleration but a low top speed, one with slow acceleration and a high-top
    speed, and a tractor trailer that is slow to accelerate and has a low top speed
    but can haul a lot of stuff at once. The first car would shine if we only cared
    about latency: the time for the first packet to arrive. The second car would shine
    if we cared about how quickly a small workload could be taken from place to place.
    This is most like measuring IOPS. The tractor trailer will be unbeatable if our
    concern is how much total data can be hauled between systems over the duration
    of the system. That''s our throughput or bandwidth. With cars, most people think
    of a *fast car* as the one with the best top speed, but with storage most people
    think about the tractor trailer example as what they want to measure, but not
    what *feels* fast when they use it. In reality, performance is a matter of perspective.

    IOPS。拖车则在我们关心的是在系统之间传输的数据量时无可匹敌，这就是我们的吞吐量或带宽。对于汽车，大多数人认为*快车*是指最高速度最快的车，但在存储领域，大多数人认为拖车的例子是他们想要衡量的目标，而不是*在使用时感觉*快的东西。实际上，性能是一个视角问题，不同的工作负载对性能的感知是不同的。

    benefit little from total throughput and so really benefit from solid state storage.

    it is going to delete and update it once the file is deleted. node C can tell
    what activity is going on just by reading this one small piece of the filesystem.
    All of the nodes connected know not to cache the data in this area, to state any

    correctly. The nodes have to do so voluntarily. This means that any bug in the

    access to a single node, and others. can bypass *any* and *all* controls and read,

    space of the storage on node 1 is mirrored to the entire storage space on node
    2\. But now that we have split storage on each node, we mirror the first portion
    of node 1 to a portion of node 2; and node 2 does the same but with node 3; and
    node 3 does the same but with node 4; and this same process carries on indefinitely
    until whatever the terminal node number is does this with node 1 completing the
    *circle* and every machine has RAID 1 for its data, split between two other nodes
    as its mirrored pair. In this way, we can make a Network RAID 1 ring indefinitely

    1 的第一部分镜像到节点 2 的一部分；节点 2 也会这样做，但是是与节点 3；节点 3 同样与节点 4 进行镜像；这个过程将无限延续，直到终端节点编号的机器与节点

    brought in to work on some large-scale databases in this two-admin shop. The senior
    admin was out on vacation and only the junior admin was still around. The environment
    used a highly redundant and high availability SAN system on which all systems
    depended. There was an extreme amount of protection of this system from UPS to
    generators to hardware redundancy all at great expense.

- en: While I was there, the junior admin decided to do some maintenance on the SAN
    and, for whatever reason, accidentally clicked to delete all of the volumes on
    the SAN. This was, of course, an accident but a very careless one by someone who
    was assuming that every possible failure scenario was carefully guarded against.
    But all of the high availability, all of the redundancy, all of the special technology
    did nothing to address simple human error.

    have stepped in to assist were instead engaged in getting her an ambulance. Through
    poor technological planning, and through poor human planning, an easily avoidable
    disaster that should have only turned into a minor recovery disaster turned into
    a huge outage. Luckily there were good backups, and the system was able to be
    restored relatively quickly. But it highlighted well just how much we often invest
    in protecting against mechanical failure and how little we address human frailty
    and, in reality, it is human error that is far more likely to be the cause of
    a disaster than machines failing.

- en: Now in the past, if this was 2004, we would generally stop here and say that
    we have described what a real world server is likely going to look like if it
    is implemented well. But this is not 2004 by a long shot and we really need to
    talk more about how we are likely going to see our storage used in the most common
    scenarios. So today we need to think about how our virtualization layers are going
    to use this storage, because things get even more interesting here.

  zh: 现在，在过去，如果这是2004年，我们通常会到此为止，并说我们已经描述了一个如果实施得当的真实世界服务器可能会看起来像什么。但现在已经不是2004年了，我们确实需要更多地讨论我们如何可能在最常见的场景中使用我们的存储。因此，今天我们需要考虑我们的虚拟化层如何使用这些存储，因为这里的事情变得更加有趣。
- en: We will assume that our /data filesystem that we just created will be used to
    store the drive images of a few virtual machines. Of course, these drive images
    are just individual files that we store in the filesystem. Very simple. No different
    than creating and storing a text file in /data (except VM drive images tend to
    be just a tad larger.)

  zh: 我们将假设我们刚创建的/data文件系统将用于存储几台虚拟机的驱动器映像。当然，这些驱动器映像只是我们存储在文件系统中的个别文件。非常简单。与在/data中创建和存储文本文件没有什么不同（除了VM驱动器映像往往稍微大一些）。
- en: What is neat about a drive imagine (this could be a QCOW, VHD, ISO, or other)
    is that they sit on top of a filesystem but, when opened by a special driver that
    is able to read them, they present a block interface again! That is right. We
    have gone from block to block to block to block to filesystem to block again!
    In some unique cases we might not even use a hypervisor but might use this new
    block device file somewhere in our regular server. Windows does this commonly
    with VHD files as a way to pass data around in certain circumstances. MacOS does
    this as their standard means of creating installer packages. On Linux it is far
    less common but just as available.

  zh: 关于驱动映像的好处（这可以是QCOW、VHD、ISO或其他格式）是它们位于文件系统的顶部，但是当它们被能够读取它们的特殊驱动程序打开时，它们再次呈现一个块接口！没错。我们从块到块再到块再到块再到文件系统再到块！在某些独特的情况下，我们甚至可能不使用虚拟化程序，而是在我们的常规服务器中的某个地方使用这个新的块设备文件。Windows通常使用VHD文件在某些情况下传递数据。MacOS使用它作为创建安装程序包的标准方式。在Linux上，这种情况远不常见，但同样可用。
- en: But assuming that we are doing something normal, we will assume that we are
    running a hypervisor, KVM almost certainly, and that the virtual machines that
    are going to run on KVM are going to use disk image files storage on our newly
    minted file system. In this case, much of what we have done here is likely to
    happen yet again inside of that virtual machine.

  zh: 假设我们正在做正常的操作，我们可以假设我们正在运行一个虚拟化管理程序，几乎可以肯定是KVM，并且在KVM上运行的虚拟机将使用我们新创建的文件系统上的磁盘镜像文件存储。在这种情况下，我们在这里做的大部分工作，很可能会在那个虚拟机内部再次发生。
- en: Some portions would not be very sensible to recreate. The physical drives are
    already managed by a physical RAID controller. The speed, capacity, and reliability
    of the storage is already established by that system and does not need to be duplicated
    here. The standard approach is for a single drive image file to be presented to
    the operating system running in a virtual machine as a single block device. No
    different than how our operating system was presented with the block device from
    the hardware RAID controller.

  zh: 有些部分可能不太适合重新创建。物理硬盘已经由物理RAID控制器管理。存储的速度、容量和可靠性已经由该系统确立，不需要在这里重复。标准方法是将单个驱动器镜像文件作为单一块设备呈现给在虚拟机中运行的操作系统。这与我们从硬件RAID控制器中获得的块设备没有什么不同。
- en: Now inside of the virtual machine we will often run through the same exercise.
    We add the presented block device as an LVM physical volume. Then we add that
    physical volume to a volume group. Then we carve out one or more logical volumes
    from that volume group. We then format that logical volume with our filesystem
    of choice and mount it. Of course, typically much of that is not done by hand
    as we have done here but rather than the installation process automating much
    of it.

  zh: 现在在虚拟机内部，我们通常会进行相同的操作。我们将呈现的块设备添加为LVM物理卷。然后我们将该物理卷添加到卷组中。接着我们从该卷组中划分出一个或多个逻辑卷。然后我们使用选择的文件系统对该逻辑卷进行格式化并挂载它。当然，通常这些步骤并不是像我们在这里做的那样手动完成，而是由安装过程自动化处理。
- en: We can add more steps such as using MD RAID. Or we can use fewer, such as by
    skipping LVM entirely. We could do all of the same steps with just a single hard
    drive and no RAID controller. This would be far less powerful physically, but
    all of the examples would work the same at a technical level. We could use VLM
    on the physical machine but not in the virtual machines, or vice versa! The flexibility
    is there to do what is needed. It is all about understanding how block devices
    can be layered, how a filesystem goes on a block device and how block files can
    turn a filesystem back into block devices!

  zh: 我们可以增加更多步骤，例如使用MD RAID，或者减少一些步骤，比如完全跳过LVM。我们也可以仅用一个硬盘而没有RAID控制器完成所有相同的步骤。虽然在物理上这会弱一些，但从技术层面上看，所有的示例仍然有效。我们可以在物理机上使用LVM，但在虚拟机中不使用，或者反过来！灵活性在于根据需求来进行操作。关键在于理解块设备如何层叠，文件系统如何应用于块设备，以及块文件如何将文件系统转回块设备！

- en: We have covered storage basics building on the concepts of block device interfaces,
    abstraction techniques, filesystems and their interfaces, and used these concepts
    to investigate multi-device redundancy and how it can be used to build complex
    and robust data storage, and how storage access across devices can be handled
    to meet any potential need. My goal here has been to give you the knowledge necessary
    to think carefully on your own about your storage needs for any given workload,
    and an understanding of availability technologies and how you can apply them to
    meet those goals most effectively.
