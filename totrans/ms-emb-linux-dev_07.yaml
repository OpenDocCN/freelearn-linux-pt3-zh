- en: This part is meant to help you set up your development environment and create
    a working platform for the later phases. You will learn how to automate the process
    of generating a bootable image by leveraging an embedded Linux build system, either
    Buildroot or The Yocto Project. Automating complex build tasks accelerates the
    project life cycle so that teams can deliver higher-quality products in less time.
    The section ends with in-depth coverage of The Yocto Project.
