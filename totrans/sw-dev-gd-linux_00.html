<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Many software engineers are new to Unix-like systems, even though these systems are everywhere in the software engineering world. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">Whether developers know it or not, they’re expected to work with Unix-like systems running in their work environment (macOS), their software development process (Docker containers), their build and automation tooling (CI and GitHub), their production environments (Linux servers and containers), and more.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Being skilled with the Linux command line can help software developers go beyond what’s expected of them, allowing them to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Save time by knowing when to use built-in Unix tools, instead of writing thousand-line scripts or helper programs</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Help debug complex production outages, often involving Linux servers and their interface to the application</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Mentor junior engineers</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Have a more complete understanding of how the software they write fits into the larger ecosystem and tech stack</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">We hope that the theory, examples, and projects included in this book can take your Linux development skills to the next level.</span></p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-5"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">Who this book is for</span></h1>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">This book is for software developers who are new to Linux and the command line, or who are out of practice and want to quickly dust off their skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">If you still feel a bit insecure about your abilities when you’re staring at a Linux command-line prompt on a production server at 2:00 in the morning, this book is for you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">If you want to quickly fill a Linux skills gap to advance your career, this book is for you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.4">If you’re just curious, and you want to see what kind of efficiency gains you can make in your day-to-day development setup and routines by adding some command-line magic, this book will serve you as well.</span></p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-6"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">What this book is not</span></h1>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">One of the ways we have tried to fulfill our vision for this kind of uniquely useful book is by being extremely careful about what’s included. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">We’ve tried to cut out everything that isn’t essential to your life as a developer, or to a basic understanding of Linux and its core abstractions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">In other words, the reason this book is useful is because of </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">all the things we left out</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">This book is not a full Linux course. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">It’s not for people working as Linux system engineers or kernel developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">Because of this, it’s not 750+ pages long, and you should be able to work through it in a few days, perhaps during a quiet sprint at work.</span></p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-7"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">What this book covers</span></h1>
<p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Chapter 1</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">How the Command Line Works</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">, explains how a command-line interface works, what a shell is, and then immediately gives you some basic Linux skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">You’ll get a bit of theory and then begin moving around on the command line, finding and working with files and learning where to look for help when you get stuck. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.3">This chapter caters to new developers by teaching the most important command-line skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.4">If you read nothing else, you’ll still be better off than when you started.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Chapter 4</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Using Shell History</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">, is a short chapter covering some tricks that you can learn to improve your speed and efficiency on the command line. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">These tricks revolve around using shortcuts and leveraging shell history to avoid repeated keystrokes.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Chapter 5</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">Introducing Files</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">, introduces files as the essential abstraction through which to understand Linux. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">You’ll be introduced to the </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">FHS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">), which is like a map that you can use to orient yourself on any Unix system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">Then it’s time for practical commands for working with files and directories in Linux, including some special filetypes you probably haven’t heard of. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">You’ll also get a taste of searching for files and file content, which is one of the most powerful bits of knowledge to have at your fingertips as a developer.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Chapter 6</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">Editing Files on the Command Line</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">, introduces two text editors – nano and vim. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">You will learn the basics of using these text editors for command-line editing while also becoming aware of common editing mistakes and how to avoid them.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Chapter 8</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Ownership and Permissions</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">, builds on the previous chapter’s explanation of users and groups to show you how access control works for resources in Linux. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">This chapter teaches you about ownership and permissions by walking you through file information from a long listing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">From there, we’ll look at the common file and directory permissions that you’ll encounter on production Linux systems, before engaging with the Linux commands for modifying file ownership and permissions.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Chapter 9</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">Managing Installed Software</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">, shows you how to install software on various Linux distributions (and even macOS). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">First, we introduce package managers, which are the preferred way of getting software onto a machine: you’ll learn the important theory and practical commands for the package management operations you’ll need as a software developer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.3">Then we’ll introduce a few other methods, like downloading install scripts and the time-honored, artisanal Unix tradition of compiling your own software locally, from source (it’s not as scary as it sounds!).</span></p>
<p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">Chapter 10</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Configuring Software</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">, piggybacks off the previous chapter’s focus on installing software by helping you with configuring software on a Linux system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">You will learn about the places that most software will look for configuration (“the configuration hierarchy”). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">Not only will this knowledge come in handy during late-night troubleshooting sessions, but it can actually help you to write better software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.4">We’ll cover command-line arguments, environment variables, configuration files, and how all of this works on non-standard Linux environments like Docker containers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.5">There’s even a little bonus project: you’ll see how to take a custom program and turn it into its own </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">systemd</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1"> service.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">Chapter 12</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Automating Tasks with Shell Scripts</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">, serves as a Bash scripting crash course, teaching you how to go from typing individual commands in an interactive shell to writing scripts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">We assume you’re already a software developer, so this will be a quick introduction that shows you the core language features and doesn’t spend a lot of time re-explaining the basics of programming. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">You’ll learn about Bash syntax, best practices for script writing, and some important pitfalls to avoid.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Chapter 13</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Secure Remote Access with SSH</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">, explores the Secure Shell Protocol and the related command-line tools available to you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">You’ll learn the basics of </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">public-key cryptography</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">PKI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">), which is always useful for a developer to know, before diving into creating SSH keys and securely logging into remote systems over the network. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">You’ll build on this knowledge and get some experience copying files over the network, using SSH to create ad-hoc proxies or VPNs, and see examples of various other tasks that involve moving data over an encrypted SSH tunnel.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Chapter 14</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">Version Control with Git</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">, shows you how to use a tool you probably already know well – </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">git</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1"> – from the command line, instead of through your IDE or a graphical client. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">We quickly go through the basic theory behind git and then jump into the commands you’ll need to use in a command-line environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.3">We’ll cover two powerful features that it pays to understand – bisecting and rebasing – and then give you our take on best practices and useful shell aliases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.4">Finally, the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Poor man’s GitHub</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1"> section presents a small but legitimately useful project that you can do to practice and integrate the Linux skills you’ve learned up to this point.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Chapter 15</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Containerizing Applications with Docker</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">, gives you the basic theory and practical skills that will make it easy to work with Docker as a developer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">We’ll explore the problems that Docker solves, explain the most important Docker concepts, and take you through the core workflow and commands you’ll use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.3">You’ll also see how to build your own images by containerizing a real application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.4">And because we’re approaching this from a software development and Linux perspective, you’ll also develop a good intuition for how containerization works under the hood, and how it’s different from virtual machines.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">Chapter 16</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">Monitoring Application Logs</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">, gives an overview of logging on Unix and Linux. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">We’ll show you how (and where) logs are collected on most modern Linux systems using </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">systemd</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">, and how more traditional approaches work (you’ll come across both in the real world). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">You’ll build practical command-line skills finding and viewing logs and learn a bit about how logging is being done in larger infrastructures.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">Chapter 17</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">Load Balancing and HTTP</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">, covers the basics of HTTP for developers, with a special focus on the complexities that you’ll come across when working with HTTP services in larger infrastructures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">We’ll correct some common misunderstandings about HTTP statuses, HTTP headers, and HTTP versions and how applications should handle them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.3">We’ll also introduce how load balancers and proxies work in the real world, and how they make the experience of troubleshooting a live application quite different from troubleshooting a development version on your laptop. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.4">Many of the Linux skills that you will have learned up to this point will come in handy here, and we’ll introduce a new tool – </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">curl</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1"> – to help you troubleshoot a wide variety of HTTP-related issues.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">If you can get yourself to a Linux shell prompt – by installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine or running it as a Docker container, for example – you can follow along with everything in this book.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">You can get away with even less – on Windows, there’s WSL, and macOS is a bona-fide Unix operating system, so almost all of the practical commands you learn in this book (except those called out as Linux-only) will work out of the box. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">That said, for the best experience, follow along on a Linux operating system.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">The skills required to get the most out of this book are only the basic computer skills that you already have as a software developer – editing text, working with files and folders, having some notion of what “operating systems” are, installing software, and using a development environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">Everything beyond that, we’ll teach you.</span></p>
