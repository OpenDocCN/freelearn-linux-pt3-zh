- en: Enterprise Linux stands out as the premier choice for organizations seeking
    a robust, secure, and reliable operating system. In the realm of Linux distributions,
    Enterprise Linux, exemplified by distributions such as Oracle Linux and Rocky
    Linux, has earned its reputation as the go-to solution for businesses worldwide.
    This book explores the key reasons why Oracle Linux is considered the best distribution
    for enterprise environments and explores several technologies, including Oracle’s
    distribution, through a series of easy-to-follow, step-by-step examples called
    recipes. These recipes will teach you how to use technologies in several key areas.

- en: Security is paramount in enterprise environments, and Oracle Linux has set the
    standard for robust security features. Features such as **Security-Enhanced Linux**
    (**SELinux**), mandatory access control, and a proactive security patching system
    for no-downtime patching contribute to creating a secure environment. Regular
    security audits and prompt zero-downtime patching help mitigate vulnerabilities,
    making Oracle Linux a trusted choice for handling sensitive and mission-critical
    data.

- en: Enterprise Linux distributions are designed to scale seamlessly, whether on
    a single server or in a large-scale, clustered environment. The performance optimizations
    integrated into these distributions ensure that they can handle the demands of
    modern enterprise applications. Oracle Linux is the leader in performance, with
    the option to use the Oracle **Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel** (**UEK**). This
    book covers how to install this option and shows several of the key features it
    brings to the table, such as the Btrfs filesystem. We also cover availability,
    with more easy-to-follow recipes that cover highly available storage and application
    clustering.

- en: Oracle Linux benefits from a vast ecosystem of software and applications that
    are certified and optimized for compatibility. This ecosystem includes database
    management systems, development tools, middleware, and enterprise applications,
    making it easier for organizations to build, deploy, and manage their software
    stacks. This book highlights some of these technologies that support DevOps and
    DevSecOps teams, such as Ansible and Podman.

- en: Oracle Linux stands tall as the best distribution for enterprise environments
    due to its rock-solid stability, robust security features, scalability, comprehensive
    support, compliance with industry standards, and a rich ecosystem. Whether managing
    critical workloads, securing sensitive data, or ensuring high-performance computing,
    Enterprise Linux continues to be the top choice for organizations aiming for a
    reliable and secure operating system.
