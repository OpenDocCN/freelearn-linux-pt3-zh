- en: Ubuntu Linux is one of a number of variants (also referred to as distributions)
    of the Linux operating system and is the product of a U.K. company named Canonical
    Ltd. The company was founded in 1994 by Mark Shuttleworth. The origins of Linux,
    however, go back even further. This chapter will outline the history of both the
    Linux operating system and Ubuntu.

  zh: Ubuntu Linux 是 Linux 操作系统的众多变种之一（也称为发行版），由英国公司 Canonical Ltd. 开发。这家公司由 Mark
    Shuttleworth 于 1994 年创立。然而，Linux 的起源可以追溯得更远。本章将概述 Linux 操作系统和 Ubuntu 的历史。

  zh: 2.1 Linux 究竟是什么？
- en: Linux is an operating system in much the same way that Windows is an operating
    system (and there any similarities between Linux and Windows end). The term operating
    system is used to describe the software that acts as a layer between the hardware
    in a computer and the applications that we all run on a daily basis. When programmers
    write applications, they interface with the operating system to perform such tasks
    as writing files to the hard disk drive and displaying information on the screen.
    Without an operating system, every programmer would have to write code to access
    the hardware of the system directly. In addition, the programmer would have to
    be able to support every single piece of hardware ever created to be sure the
    application would work on every possible hardware configuration. Because the operating
    system handles all of this hardware complexity, application development becomes
    a much easier task. Linux is just one of a number of different operating systems
    available today.

  zh: Linux 是一种操作系统，就像 Windows 是操作系统一样（这两者之间的相似之处就到此为止）。操作系统这一术语用来描述在计算机硬件和我们每天使用的应用程序之间充当中介的软件。当程序员编写应用程序时，他们通过操作系统与硬件进行交互，以完成如将文件写入硬盘驱动器和在屏幕上显示信息等任务。如果没有操作系统，每个程序员都必须编写代码来直接访问系统的硬件。此外，程序员还需要能够支持所有已创建的硬件，以确保应用程序在每种可能的硬件配置上都能正常运行。因为操作系统处理了所有这些硬件复杂性，所以应用程序的开发变得更加容易。Linux
    只是当今众多操作系统中的一种。

  zh: 2.2 UNIX 的起源
- en: To understand the history of Linux, we first have to go back to AT&T Bell Laboratories
    in the late 1960s. During this time, AT&T had discontinued involvement in developing
    a new operating system named Multics. However, two AT&T engineers, Ken Thompson,
    and Dennis Ritchie, decided to take what they had learned from the Multics project
    and create a new operating system named UNIX which quickly gained popularity and
    wide adoption both with corporations and academic institutions.

  zh: 要了解 Linux 的历史，我们首先要回到 1960 年代末期的 AT&T 贝尔实验室。那时，AT&T 停止了开发名为 Multics 的新操作系统。然而，AT&T
    的两位工程师 Ken Thompson 和 Dennis Ritchie 决定将他们从 Multics 项目中学到的知识应用于创建一种新的操作系统 UNIX，并且该操作系统迅速在企业和学术机构中获得了广泛的应用和认可。
- en: A variety of proprietary UNIX implementations eventually came to market, including
    those created by IBM (AIX), Hewlett-Packard (HP-UX), and Sun Microsystems (SunOS
    and Solaris). In addition, a UNIX-like operating system named MINIX was created
    by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and designed for educational use with source code access
    provided to universities.

  zh: 2.3 谁创造了 Linux？
- en: The origins of Linux can be traced back to the work and philosophies of two
    people. At the heart of the Linux operating system is something called the kernel.
    This is the core set of features necessary for the operating system to function.
    The kernel manages the system’s resources and handles communication between the
    hardware and the applications. The Linux kernel was developed by Linus Torvalds,
    who, taking a dislike to MS-DOS and impatient for the availability of MINIX for
    the new Intel 80386 microprocessor, decided to write his own UNIX-like kernel.
    When he had finished the first version of the kernel, he released it under an
    open-source license that enabled anyone to download the source code and freely
    use and modify it without having to pay Linus any money.

  zh: Linux的起源可以追溯到两个人的工作和理念。在Linux操作系统的核心部分，有一个叫做内核的东西。这是操作系统正常运行所必需的一组核心功能。内核管理系统资源，并处理硬件与应用程序之间的通信。Linux内核是由Linus
    Torvalds开发的，他对MS-DOS心生厌恶，并且对新款英特尔80386微处理器上MINIX的可用性感到不耐烦，于是决定编写自己的类UNIX内核。当他完成了内核的第一个版本后，他以开源许可发布了它，允许任何人下载源代码，并自由使用和修改，而不必向Linus支付任何费用。
- en: Around the same time, Richard Stallman at the Free Software Foundation, a strong
    advocate of free and open-source software, was working on an open-source operating
    system of his own. Rather than focusing initially on the kernel, however, Stallman
    began by developing open-source versions of all the UNIX tools, utilities, and
    compilers necessary to use and maintain an operating system. By the time he had
    finished developing this infrastructure, the obvious solution was to combine his
    work with the kernel Linus had written to create a complete operating system.
    This combination became known as GNU/Linux. Purists insist that Linux always be
    referred to as GNU/Linux (in fact, at one time, Richard Stallman refused to give
    press interviews to any publication which failed to refer to Linux as GNU/Linux).
    This is not unreasonable, given that the GNU tools developed by the Free Software
    Foundation make up a significant and vital part of GNU/Linux. Unfortunately, most
    people and publications refer to Linux as Linux, which will probably always continue
    to be the case.

  zh: 大约在同一时期，Richard Stallman在自由软件基金会工作，他是自由和开源软件的坚定倡导者，也在开发自己的开源操作系统。然而，Stallman并未首先专注于内核，而是从开发所有必要的UNIX工具、实用程序和编译器的开源版本开始，以便使用和维护操作系统。当他完成这一基础设施的开发时，显然的解决方案是将他的工作与Linus编写的内核结合，创建一个完整的操作系统。这个组合被称为GNU/Linux。纯粹主义者坚持认为Linux应始终被称为GNU/Linux（实际上，曾有一段时间，Richard
    Stallman拒绝接受任何未将Linux称为GNU/Linux的出版物的采访）。这一要求并不无理，因为自由软件基金会开发的GNU工具构成了GNU/Linux的重要和关键部分。不幸的是，大多数人和出版物称其为Linux，这种情况可能永远不会改变。

- en: A South African internet mogul named Mark Shuttleworth (who made his fortune
    selling his company to VeriSign for around $500 million) decided it was time for
    a more user-friendly Linux. He took the Debian distribution and worked to make
    it a more human-friendly distribution which he called Ubuntu. He subsequently
    formed a company called Canonical Ltd to promote and provide support for Ubuntu.
