  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Along with acting as a web server, email is one of the primary uses of an Ubuntu
    system, particularly in business environments. Given the importance and popularity
    of email, it is surprising to some people to find out how complex the email structure
    is on a Linux system. This complexity can often be overwhelming to the Ubuntu
    newcomer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The good news is that much of the complexity is there to allow experienced email
    administrators to implement complicated configurations for large-scale enterprise
    installations. However, for most Linux administrators, setting up a basic email
    system is relatively straightforward so that users can send and receive electronic
    mail.

- en: This chapter of Ubuntu Essentials will explain the basics of Linux-based email
    configuration and step through configuring a basic email environment. To provide
    the essentials, we will leave the complexities of the email system for more advanced
    books on the subject.

    of each one:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 32.1.1 Mail User Agent
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The typical user will likely be most familiar with this part of the system.
    The Mail User Agent (MUA), or mail client, is the application that is used to
    write, send and read email messages. Anyone who has written and sent a message
    on any computer has used a Mail User Agent of one type or another.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typical Graphical MUAs on Linux are Evolution, Thunderbird, and KMail. For those
    who prefer a text-based mail client, there are also the more traditional Pine
    and mail tools.

- en: 32.1.2 Mail Transfer Agent
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) is the part of the email system that transfers
    email messages from one computer to another (either on the same local network
    or over the internet to a remote system). Once configured correctly, most users
    will only directly interact with their chosen MTA if they wish to re-configure
    it. Many MTA choices are available for Linux, including Sendmail, Postfix, Fetchmail,
    Qmail, and Exim.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 32.1.3 Mail Delivery Agent
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another part of the infrastructure typically hidden from the user, the Mail
    Delivery Agent (MDA), sits in the background and performs filtering of the email
    messages between the Mail Transfer Agent and the mail client (MUA). The most popular
    form of MDA is a spam filter to remove all unwanted email messages from the system
    before they reach the inbox of the user’s mail client (MUA). Popular MDAs are
    Spamassassin and Procmail. It is important to note that some Mail User Agent applications
    (such as Evolution, Thunderbird, and KMail) include their own MDA filtering. Others,
    such as Pine and Basla, do not. This can be a source of confusion for the Linux
    beginner.

- en: 32.1.4 SMTP
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SMTP is an acronym for Simple Mail Transport Protocol. The email systems use
    this protocol to transfer mail messages from one server to another. This protocol
    is the communication language that the MTAs use to talk to each other and transfer
    messages back and forth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 32.1.5 SMTP Relay
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SMTP Relay is a protocol that allows an external SMTP server to send emails
    instead of hosting a local SMTP server. This will typically involve using a service
    such as Mailjet, SendGrid, or MailGun. These services avoid configuring and maintaining
    your own SMTP server and often provide additional benefits such as analytics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 32.2 Configuring an Ubuntu Email Server
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many systems use the Sendmail MTA to transfer email messages; on many Linux
    distributions, this is the default Mail Transfer Agent. Unfortunately, Sendmail
    is a complex system that can be difficult for beginners and experienced users
    to understand and configure. It is also falling from favor because it is considered
    slower at processing email messages than many of the more recent MTAs available.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many system administrators are now using Postfix or Qmail to handle email. Both
    are faster and easier to configure than Sendmail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For this chapter, therefore, we will look at Postfix as an MTA because of its
    simplicity and popularity. However, if you prefer to use Sendmail, many books
    specialize in the subject and will do the subject much more justice than we can
    in this chapter.

    as a full email server. Later in the chapter, the steps to use an SMTP Relay service

    Mail Exchanger (MX) record. This record defines where emails addressed to your
    domain should be sent and is usually set by default to a mail server provided
    by your registrar. If you are hosting your own mail server, the MX record should
    be set to your domain or the IP address of your mail server. The steps to make
    this change will depend on your domain registrar but generally involves editing
    the DNS information for the domain and either adding or editing an existing MX
    record so that it points to your email server.
