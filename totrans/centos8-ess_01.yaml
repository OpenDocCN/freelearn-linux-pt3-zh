- en: CentOS is one of a number of variants (also referred to as distributions) of
    the Linux operating system. It is based on the source code of the Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux distribution, developed by a U.S. company named Red Hat, Inc., based in
    Raleigh, North Carolina. The company was founded in the mid-1990s through the
    merger of two companies owned at the time by Marc Ewing and Bob Young. The origins
    of Linux, however, go back even further. This chapter will outline the history
    of both the Linux operating system and Red Hat, Inc. before explaining how CentOS
    fits into this picture.

- en: Linux is an operating system in much the same way that Windows is an operating
    system (and there any similarities between Linux and Windows end). The term operating
    system is used to describe the software that acts as a layer between the hardware
    in a computer and the applications that we all run on a daily basis. When programmers
    write applications, they interface with the operating system to perform such tasks
    as writing files to the hard disk drive and displaying information on the screen.
    Without an operating system, every programmer would have to write code to directly
    access the hardware of the system. In addition, the programmer would have to be
    able to support every single piece of hardware ever created to be sure the application
    would work on every possible hardware configuration. Because the operating system
    handles all of this hardware complexity, application development becomes a much
    easier task. Linux is just one of a number of different operating systems available
    today.

- en: To understand the history of Linux, we first have to go back to AT&T Bell Laboratories
    in the late 1960s. During this time AT&T had discontinued involvement in the development
    of a new operating system named Multics. Two AT&T engineers, Ken Thompson and
    Dennis Ritchie, decided to take what they had learned from the Multics project
    and create a new operating system named UNIX which quickly gained popularity and
    wide adoption both with corporations and academic institutions.

    those created by IBM (AIX), Hewlett-Packard (HP-UX) and Sun Microsystems (SunOS
    and Solaris). In addition, a UNIX-like operating system named MINIX was created
    by Andrew S. Tanenbaum designed for educational use with source code access provided
    to universities.

- en: The origins of Linux can be traced back to the work and philosophies of two
    people. At the heart of the Linux operating system is something called the kernel.
    This is the core set of features necessary for the operating system to function.
    The kernel manages the system’s resources and handles communication between the
    hardware and the applications. The Linux kernel was developed by Linus Torvalds
    who, taking a dislike to MS-DOS, and impatient for the availability of MINIX for
    the new Intel 80386 microprocessor, decided to write his own UNIX-like kernel.
    When he had finished the first version of the kernel, he released it under an
    open source license that enabled anyone to download the source code and freely
    use and modify it without having to pay Linus any money.

- en: Around the same time, Richard Stallman at the Free Software Foundation, a strong
    advocate of free and open source software, was working on an open source operating
    system of his own. Rather than focusing initially on the kernel, however, Stallman
    decided to begin by developing open source versions of all the UNIX tools, utilities
    and compilers necessary to use and maintain an operating system. By the time he
    had finished developing this infrastructure it seemed like the obvious solution
    was to combine his work with the kernel Linus had written to create a full operating
    system. This combination became known as GNU/Linux. Purists insist that Linux
    always be referred to as GNU/Linux (in fact, at one time, Richard Stallman refused
    to give press interviews to any publication which failed to refer to Linux as
    GNU/Linux). This is not unreasonable given that the GNU tools developed by the
    Free Software Foundation make up a significant and vital part of GNU/Linux. Unfortunately,
    most people and publications simply refer to Linux as Linux and this will probably
    always continue to be the case.

    Young, he ran from his “wife’s sewing closet”. The name ACC was intended to represent
    a catalog business but was also an abbreviation of a small business his wife ran
    called “Antiques and Collectibles of Connecticut”. Among the items sold through
    the ACC catalog business were Linux CDs and related open source software.

    rapid and significant growth. Bob Young stepped down as CEO shortly after the
    company went public in August of 1999 and has since pursued a number of business
    and philanthropic efforts including a print-on-demand book publishing company
    named Lulu and ownership of two Canadian professional sports teams. In 2018, IBM
    announced plans to acquire Red Hat, Inc. in a deal valued at $34 billion.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Early releases of Red Hat Linux were shipped to customers on floppy disks and
    CDs (this, of course, predated the widespread availability of broadband internet
    connections). When users encountered problems with the software they were only
    able to contact Red Hat by email. In fact, Bob Young often jokes that this was
    effective in limiting support requests since, by the time a customer realized
    they needed help, their computer was usually inoperative and therefore unavailable
    to be used to send an email message seeking assistance from Red Hat’s support
    team. In later years Red Hat provided better levels of support tied to paid subscriptions
    and now provides a variety of support levels ranging from “self help” (no support)
    up to premium support.

    is primarily targeted at corporate, mission critical installations. It is also
    the cornerstone of an expanding ecosystem of products and services offered by
    Red Hat. RHEL is an open source product in that you can download the source code
    free of charge and build the software yourself if you wish to do so (a task not
    to be undertaken lightly). If, however, you wish to download a pre-built, ready
    to install binary version of the software (either with or without support), you
    have to pay for it.

    to a free Linux operating system (in both source and binary distributions) in
    the form of Fedora Linux. Fedora Linux also serves as a proving ground for many
    of the new features that are eventually adopted into the Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    operating system family. CentOS 8.0, for example, was based to a large extent
    on Fedora 29.

    option is provided in the form of the CentOS operating system. The CentOS project,
    originally a community driven effort but now a collaboration with Red Hat, takes
    the Red Hat Enterprise Linux source code, removes the Red Hat branding and subscription
    requirements, compiles it and provides the distribution for download. Of course,
    while CentOS provides an operating system that is identical to RHEL in many ways,
    it does not include access to Red Hat technical support.

    of a wide range of different Linux distributions. One such distribution is Red
    Hat Enterprise Linux, created by Red Hat, Inc., a company founded by Bob Young
    and Mark Ewing. Red Hat specializes in providing enterprise level Linux software
    solutions combined with extensive technical support services. CentOS is essentially
    built from the same source code base as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but with the
    Red Hat branding removed.
