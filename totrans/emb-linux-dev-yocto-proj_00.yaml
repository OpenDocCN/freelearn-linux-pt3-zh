    It provides a rich set of tools to help you use most of your energy and resources
    in your product development instead of reinventing the wheel.

- en: The usual tasks and requirements of embedded Linux-based products and development
    teams were the guideline for this book’s conception. However, being written by
    active community members with a practical and straightforward approach is a stepping
    stone for both your learning curve and the product’s project.

    about some of the topics that are not covered or are just briefly mentioned in
    the text, such as Git and general knowledge of Linux kernel and its basic compilation
    process.

    concepts detailed in this book, we recommend the open sourced booklet, *Heading
    for the Yocto Project*, found in the Git repository at [https://git.io/vFUiI](https://git.io/vFUiI);
    the content of this booklet is intended to help newcomers to gain a better understanding
    of the goals of the Yocto Project and its potential uses. It provides an overview
    of the project before diving into the technical details of how things can be done.

    is required, as well as the general concepts used in development, such as compilation,
    debugging, deployment, and installation. In addition, some experience with shell
    script and Python is a bonus because these programming languages are core technologies
    used extensively by the Yocto Project’s tools.

    the book *Mastering Embedded Linux Programming - Third Edition*, ISBN-13 978-1789530384,
    by Chris Simmonds.
