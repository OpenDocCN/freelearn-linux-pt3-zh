			<p>As we progress in our comprehensive series on frequently used commands for system administrators, the <strong class="bold">command-line interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">CLI</strong>) is an essential tool for getting many tasks done. The <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>CLI offers a streamlined and efficient way to perform various tasks, from managing files and directories to monitoring system performance and troubleshooting issues. In this section, we will delve into frequently used commands and explore their usefulness, execution, and best practices for effective system administration. By mastering these commands, system administrators can work more efficiently and effectively, making the most of their <span class="No-Break">computing resources.</span></p>
			<p>As a system administrator, managing storage and filesystems is an essential part of ensuring the smooth operation of a system. The ability to format, partition, and manage disk space is critical for managing files, backing up important data, and maintaining system stability. In this chapter, we will explore the various commands used for formatting and disk space management, including <strong class="source-inline">fdisk</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">lsblk</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">df</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">du</strong>, <span class="No-Break">and more.</span></p>
			<p>We will begin by discussing the history and evolution of disk formatting and partitioning, from the early days of magnetic tapes to <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>modern <strong class="bold">solid-state drives</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSDs</strong>). We will then delve into the steps involved in creating a partition and explore various commands for disk space management. Additionally, we will cover the use of package managers to display package space and explore various formatting commands such as <strong class="source-inline">mkfs</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">mke2fs</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">fdformat</strong>, and others. By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of formatting and disk space commands, enabling you to effectively manage storage and filesystems.

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>The history and evolution of disk formatting and partitioning in Linux</h1>
			<p>The history of <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>disk formatting and partitioning in Unix/Linux dates back to the early days of computing when disk storage was a scarce resource. Disk partitioning was essential in organizing disk space into smaller, manageable sections. It allowed system administrators to allocate disk space more efficiently and reduced the risk of data loss in the event of a disk failure. In the early days of Unix, disk partitioning was done using the <strong class="source-inline">fdisk</strong> command, which allowed the user to create, delete, and modify disk partitions. With the introduction of Linux, the partitioning tool was updated to use the more <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>advanced <strong class="bold">GUID Partition Table</strong> (<strong class="bold">GPT</strong>) format, which provided support for larger disks and <span class="No-Break">more partitions.</span></p>
			<p>Over time, disk formatting<a id="_idIndexMarker238"/> and partitioning in Unix/Linux have become more sophisticated, with new commands and utilities being added to improve the process. For instance, the <strong class="source-inline">mke2fs</strong> command, which is used to create an <strong class="source-inline">ext2</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">ext3</strong> filesystem, was introduced in Linux version 1.2. This command created a more efficient filesystem, which reduced the risk of data loss and made disk management more manageable. The introduction of the <strong class="source-inline">mke2fs</strong> command was a significant milestone in the evolution of disk formatting and partitioning in Unix/Linux as it allowed administrators to create more reliable filesystems and manage disk space more efficiently. The advent of cloud computing and virtualization has also had a significant impact on disk formatting and partitioning in Unix/Linux. Cloud computing has enabled the use of virtual disks, which can be partitioned and formatted using the same tools as physical disks. In virtualized environments, administrators can easily create, modify, and resize virtual disks, making it easier to manage storage space. Additionally, cloud storage providers have developed their own disk formatting and partitioning tools, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>Amazon <strong class="bold">Elastic Block Store</strong> (<strong class="bold">EBS</strong>), which allows users to create and attach virtual disks to their instances. These tools have made it easier for administrators to manage disk space in the cloud and ensure that their data is <span class="No-Break">stored securely.</span></p>
			<p>There are three types <span class="No-Break">of partitions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Primary partition</strong>: A <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/>primary partition is a basic partition that can be used to boot an operating system. In a hard disk, you can create up to four primary partitions. If you want to create more partitions, you can create an extended partition, which is a special partition that can contain multiple <span class="No-Break">logical partitions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Logical partition</strong>: A<a id="_idIndexMarker241"/> logical partition is a partition that is created within an extended partition. You can create multiple logical partitions within an extended partition, which can be useful when you want to create multiple partitions but you have already created four <span class="No-Break">primary partitions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Extended partition</strong>: An <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/>extended partition is a special partition that is used to create multiple logical partitions. An extended partition can only be created if there are no more than four primary partitions on the hard disk. Once an extended partition has been created, you can create multiple logical partitions <span class="No-Break">within it.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These partition types are used to organize and manage data on a hard disk. By creating multiple partitions, you can separate different types of data and manage them more effectively. For example, you could create a separate partition for the operating system, one for user data, and one for backup files. This can make it easier to manage your data and protect it in the event of a failure or data loss. The different types of partitions offer flexibility in how you organize your data on a hard disk, depending on your needs and the limitations of the <span class="No-Break">hard disk.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Steps to create a partition</h1>
			<p>Partitioning is<a id="_idIndexMarker243"/> the process of dividing a physical hard drive into multiple logical storage units. In Linux, the process of creating a partition involves defining the size and location of a new partition on a physical hard drive, and then formatting it with a filesystem such as <strong class="source-inline">ext4</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">XFS</strong>, or <strong class="source-inline">btrfs</strong>. Creating partitions is essential for<a id="_idIndexMarker244"/> managing disk space effectively and efficiently. With partitioning, system administrators can organize and allocate space on a hard drive to various functions such as the operating system, application files, user data, and <span class="No-Break">swap space.</span></p>
			<p>The process of creating partitions in Linux involves several steps. The first step is to identify the physical hard drive that needs to be partitioned, using the <strong class="source-inline">fdisk</strong> command or other disk management tools such as <strong class="source-inline">lsblk</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">df</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">du</strong>. Next, the system administrator must decide on the size and location of the new partition and use the <strong class="source-inline">fdisk</strong> command to create it. The new partition must then be formatted with a filesystem using the <strong class="source-inline">mkfs</strong> command. Finally, the system administrator must mount the new partition to make it accessible to the operating system and <span class="No-Break">its applications.</span></p>
			<p>Partitioning is important<a id="_idIndexMarker245"/> for several reasons. Firstly, it allows system administrators to manage disk space efficiently by organizing data into logical units. With partitioning, it becomes easier to back up and restore data, as well as to allocate space for specific applications or functions. Secondly, partitioning can improve system performance by reducing disk fragmentation and optimizing access times. Additionally, partitioning can improve security by isolating sensitive data on separate partitions and protecting it from unauthorized access. Remember that partitioning is a critical tool for system administrators to manage disk space, optimize system performance, and <span class="No-Break">enhance security.</span></p>
			<p>The demonstration will be easy as we only require a drive connected to the Linux machine, and we can begin partitioning by launching the Terminal. The commands we’ll be making use of for this partitioning are <strong class="source-inline">lsblk</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">fdisk</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">lsblk</strong> command will list the available devices so that we can select the correct one to format, and <strong class="source-inline">fdisk</strong> command will effectively format<a id="_idIndexMarker246"/> the selected device. Let’s get started with <span class="No-Break">the demonstration:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>To verify the available devices, execute the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">lsblk</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> command:</span></li>

			<p class="list-inset">As we <a id="_idIndexMarker247"/>can see, we have listed the available devices and their respective disk spaces, but our main target is the connected drive on <strong class="source-inline">/dev/sdb</strong>. Note that <strong class="source-inline">/dev</strong> represents the device directory in Linux, where hardware devices are represented as files. In this case, <strong class="source-inline">/dev/sdb</strong> is the second SCSI disk drive on the system. Notice that it already has a partition (<strong class="source-inline">sdb1</strong>). We will delete that partition, verify it again, and then create our own partition. Let’s proceed with the <span class="No-Break">next steps.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Next, execute the <strong class="source-inline">fdisk</strong> command to open its utility for the <strong class="source-inline">/dev/sdb</strong> drive.

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>fdisk, lsblk, df, and du</h1>
			<p>Among the utilities used in Linux systems to manage filesystems, ther<a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>e’s <strong class="source-inline">fdisk</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">lsblk</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">df</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">du</strong>. Each of these utilities performs a specific function in disk management, and their proper use is essential to ensure the efficient functioning of <span class="No-Break">the system.</span></p>
			<p>We introduced <strong class="source-inline">fdisk</strong>, a command-line utility that’s used to partition disks, previously. It allows <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>us to create and modify partition tables, enabling administrators to organize storage space as required. Partitioning is essential for efficiently utilizing storage space, improving system performance, and simplifying the management of the filesystem. <strong class="source-inline">fdisk</strong> can create different types of partitions, including primary, logical, and extended partitions. Additionally, it can be used to change the partition size, delete partitions, and modify partition types. Without <strong class="source-inline">fdisk</strong>, managing and organizing the filesystem would be complex, cumbersome, and prone to errors. We can call this command by simply typing <strong class="source-inline">fdisk -l</strong> to list <span class="No-Break">the partition:</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.8 – List partition with fdisk</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">lsblk</strong> is another <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>command-line utility that’s used in Linux systems to list all the available block devices, including hard drives, USB devices, and CD-ROM drives. This utility is useful in identifying the storage devices attached to the system, and the details of each block device. The output of <strong class="source-inline">lsblk</strong> provides critical information about the block devices, such as the device name, the size, the filesystem type, and the mount point. An example of this can be <span class="No-Break">seen here:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer114" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.9 – Output of block devices</p>
			<p>This information is crucial in making decisions on how to allocate storage space and organize the filesystem efficiently. <strong class="source-inline">lsblk</strong> is essential in disk management as it helps system administrators identify the storage devices attached to the system, troubleshoot device connectivity issues, and make informed decisions regarding partitioning and <span class="No-Break">disk organization.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">df</strong> (<strong class="bold">Disk Free</strong>) utility is<a id="_idIndexMarker254"/> a command-line tool that displays the disk space used and available in filesystems on Linux systems. This tool is important in monitoring filesystem usage, identifying storage space consumption patterns, and making decisions on how to allocate storage space efficiently. Let’s try and display the disk space usage for a specific filesystem, such as the <span class="No-Break">root filesystem:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.11 – Monitoring disk usage</p>
			<p>In this example, the <a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>administrator is monitoring the disk space usage on the filesystem where the website files are stored, which is mounted on <strong class="source-inline">/var/www/html</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">df</strong> command is used with the <strong class="source-inline">-h</strong> option to display the output in a human-readable format, making it easier to understand the disk space usage. The output shows the total size of the filesystem, the amount of space used, the available space, the percentage of space used, and the mount point. The administrator can use this information to identify the directories that are consuming the most space and optimize them for better performance. Additionally, the administrator can use this information to plan for future disk space needs. The <strong class="source-inline">df</strong> utility provides a detailed report on the filesystem usage, including the filesystem type, the total size, the used space, the available space, and the percentage of the disk space used. With this information, administrators can optimize disk usage, increase performance, and avoid <span class="No-Break">system crashes.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">du</strong> utility is another<a id="_idIndexMarker256"/> essential command-line tool that’s used in Linux systems to determine the amount of space used by specific directories and files. With <strong class="source-inline">du</strong>, administrators can identify files or directories that are consuming too much space and decide whether to delete, archive, or move them to another filesystem. The <strong class="source-inline">du</strong> utility also displays the amount of space used by each subdirectory, enabling administrators to pinpoint storage hogs quickly. The <strong class="source-inline">du</strong> utility’s importance in disk management cannot be overstated as it helps system administrators optimize disk usage, identify space-hogging files, and troubleshoot space <span class="No-Break">consumption issues.</span></p>

			<p>Utilities such as <strong class="source-inline">fdisk</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">lsblk</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">df</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">du</strong> are essential in managing and organizing disk space in Linux systems. <strong class="source-inline">fdisk</strong> is used in partitioning disks, <strong class="source-inline">lsblk</strong> is used in identifying the storage devices attached to the system, <strong class="source-inline">df</strong> is used in monitoring filesystem usage, and <strong class="source-inline">du</strong> is used in determining the amount of space used by specific directories and files. Proper use of these utilities is crucial in optimizing disk usage, increasing system performance, and avoiding <span class="No-Break">data loss.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Displaying (dpkg and rpm) package space</h1>
			<p>Package management systems such as <strong class="source-inline">dpkg</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">rpm</strong> are used to install, remove, and manage software packages in Linux and Unix <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>operating systems. The <strong class="source-inline">dpkg</strong> tool is used in Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu and the <strong class="source-inline">rpm</strong> tool is used in Red Hat-based systems such as CentOS. These tools not only provide an easy way to manage software packages but also offer valuable <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>information about disk space usage by the installed packages. One important use of the <strong class="source-inline">dpkg</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">rpm</strong> tools is to display the package space, which refers to the amount of disk space used by the installed packages. By using these tools, administrators can identify the packages that are consuming the most disk space and make decisions on whether to remove or keep them. This is particularly useful in systems with limited disk space, where optimizing the use of disk space is critical to avoid system crashes, performance issues, or <span class="No-Break">data loss.</span></p>
			<p>In addition, the <strong class="source-inline">dpkg</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">rpm</strong> tools<a id="_idIndexMarker266"/> provide information about the package <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>dependencies, which are other packages that are required by the installed package to function properly. This information is useful in identifying the packages that can be safely removed without affecting the system’s stability or functionality. By removing unnecessary packages, administrators can free up disk space, reduce system complexity, and improve system performance. The <strong class="source-inline">dpkg</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">rpm</strong> tools also offer an easy way to upgrade or install packages with their dependencies automatically resolved. With these tools, administrators can easily install security patches, updates, and new software packages without worrying about the dependencies. This reduces the time and effort required to manage packages and ensures that the system is up to date with the latest software versions. We are currently using CentOS 8, meaning <strong class="source-inline">rpm</strong> (<strong class="bold">Red Hat Package Manager</strong>) will be our number <span class="No-Break">one example.</span></p>

			<p>Disk formatting is the process of preparing a storage device such as a hard drive, SSD, or USB flash drive for data storage. Formatting creates a filesystem on the storage device, which allows the operating system to organize and manage files on the device. In Linux, several disk formatting tool commands can be used to format storage devices. These tools include <strong class="source-inline">mkfs</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">mke2fs</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">f<a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>dformat</strong>, <span class="No-Break">and more.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">mkfs</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker270"/> command that’s used to create a filesystem on a storage device. This command can be used to create a variety of filesystems, including <strong class="source-inline">ext2</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">ext3</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">ext4</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">XFS</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">btrfs</strong>, and more. The <strong class="source-inline">mkfs</strong> command is important in preparing storage devices for use in Linux systems. For example, when a new hard drive is added to a Linux server, it must be formatted before it can be used for data storage. Let’s examine a straightforward approach to utilize this tool on <span class="No-Break">CentOS 8:</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.17 – Formatting a partition using mkfs.ext4</p>
			<p>This will format the <strong class="source-inline">/dev/sdb1</strong> partition with the <strong class="source-inline">ext4</strong> filesystem. The newly formatted partition can then be mounted and used for <span class="No-Break">data storage.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">mke2fs</strong> is a variant of the <strong class="source-inline">mkfs</strong> command<a id="_idIndexMarker271"/> that is specifically designed to create <strong class="source-inline">ext2</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">ext3</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">ext4</strong> filesystems. The <strong class="source-inline">mke2fs</strong> command is important in creating and managing Linux filesystems. With this command, administrators can specify the size of the filesystem, the block size, and other parameters to optimize the filesystem for specific use cases. For example, a filesystem created with the <strong class="source-inline">mke2fs</strong> command can be optimized for high-performance workloads or used with large files, as shown in the <span class="No-Break">following example:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.18 – Creating an ext3 filesystem</p>
			<p>Here, the command creates an <strong class="source-inline">ext3</strong> filesystem on the <strong class="source-inline">/dev/sdb1</strong> partition. The <strong class="source-inline">-t ext3</strong> option specifies the filesystem type <span class="No-Break">as </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">ext3</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">fdformat</strong> command<a id="_idIndexMarker272"/> is primarily used for low-level formatting of floppy disks, which are legacy storage media. It writes a new disk geometry and sector layout to the floppy disk, preparing it for use. However, this command is not intended for formatting modern storage devices such as pen drives or USB <span class="No-Break">flash drives.</span></p>
			<p>For formatting pen drives or USB flash drives in Linux, <strong class="source-inline">mkfs</strong> (make filesystem) commands are typically used, such as <strong class="source-inline">mkfs.fat</strong> for creating a <strong class="source-inline">FAT</strong> filesystem or <strong class="source-inline">mkfs.ext4</strong> for creating an <strong class="source-inline">ext4</strong> filesystem, as shown in the previous examples. These commands are specifically designed for formatting different types of storage devices, including pen drives, USB flash drives, and <span class="No-Break">hard drives.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">mkswap</strong> command is <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>used to create a swap area on a Linux system. A swap area is a dedicated space on a hard drive that the system can use as virtual memory when it runs out of physical memory. The <strong class="source-inline">mkswap</strong> command initializes a disk partition or a file as a swap area and assigns it a <span class="No-Break">unique identifier.</span></p>
