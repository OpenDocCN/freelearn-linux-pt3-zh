- en: '*Linux Administration Best Practices* is a guide for understanding the context,
    decision making, and ideologies behind one of the most critical functions in business
    infrastructure: systems. Systems, that is, operating system level management,
    remains the cornerstone of communications and infrastructure. Linux remains the
    most popular operating system family of choice today and is only gaining more
    and more traction, making the need for well-trained, deeply knowledgable Linux
    administration teams that much more important.'

- en: This book is intended for those IT professionals working with Linux or as system
    administrators who want to take their craft to the next level. This book is about
    best practices and so we approach the role and thinking of the system administrator
    rather than learning individual tasks. This book will challenge how you think
    and how you approach system administration. This book will not teach you about
    the tasks of system administration, but it will teach you how to think like a
    career administrator.

    Best Practices*, attempts to take you from newbie to master regarding storage,
    which remains one of the least understood areas of system administration, taking
    a high-level approach.'

- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B16600_04_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor099)*, Designing
    System Deployment Architectures*, breaks down assessing deployment approaches
    and when different models will work for you.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Systems do not exist in a vacuum; they are deployed in conjunction with other
    systems, often needing to interoperate for functionality or redundancy. Combining
    systems in meaningful ways is complex and can be counterintuitive.

- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B16600_05_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor128)*, Patch Management
    Strategies*, looks at patching and updates, which might sound mundane but are
    at the core of any system task list, and are often more complex than is realized.
    Good patch management will help protect you and your organization from disasters
    both accidental and malicious.'

- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B16600_06_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145)*, Databases*,
    digs into database concepts and how they apply to the systems realm so that you
    can provide better support and guidance to your database users. Technically not
    part of the operating system, database management has historically fallen to system
    administrators.'

    Administration Maturation with Automation through Scripting and DevOps*, looks
    at many different ways to approach automation considering practicality and real-world
    needs in addition to perfect, theoretical approaches. Everyone talks about the
    automation of system tasks, but many organizations fail to do it.'

    Disaster Recovery Approaches*, goes far beyond conventional wisdom and approaches
    disaster recovery with a fresh eye and modernism to provide ways to make backups
    easier and more effective than they normally are. The single most important task
    in system administration is protecting data.'

    Access Management Strategies*, looks at best practices for maintaining users,
    discusses decision making and user management approaches, and investigates architectures
    for remote access to the operating system. What good is a system if no one can
    access it?'

    looks at how taking a planned, intentional approach to troubleshooting improves
    resolution speed, reduces stress, and might just find problems that would have
    been kept hidden otherwise. Nothing is harder than figuring out what to do when
    something is wrong and the pressure is on.'

- en: You are expected to have general knowledge of Linux and operating systems. We
    assume experience in working with systems in a production environment and a business
    setting. This book covers high-level concepts rather than technical processes
    and so a working knowledge of Linux and operating systems is beneficial.
  prefs: []

    Ubuntu, Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Suse.

    concepts and while knowledge of Linux and operating systems is very useful, there
    is no need to be hands-on with a running system while reading this book.
