    what a system administrator is comes from the fact that the *title* of *system
    administrator* is often given out, willy nilly, by companies with little to no
    understanding of **Information Technology** (**IT**), systems, or administration
    and treat it like a general filler for IT roles that they do not understand or
    know how to name. It also has a strong tendency to be given out in lieu of pay
    raises or promotions to entice junior staff to remain in an otherwise unrewarding
    job in the hopes that an impressive title will help them later in their career,
    so much so that in the end, the number of people working as system administrators
    is a very small number of people compared to the number of people with the title.
    In fact, it is no small stretch to guess that the average person with the title
    of system administrator has never thought about the meaning of the title and may
    have little inkling of what someone in that role would be expected to do.

    is the nature of IT that in small and medium sized companies you typically have
    generalists who *wear many hats* and do every needed IT role while having little
    to no time to focus on any one specific function. Whereas in large enterprises
    you generally get focused roles, often grouped into focused departments, that
    do just a single IT role: such as system administrator. But even in some enterprises
    you find departments organized like separate, small businesses and still having

    hiring IT generalists (akin to the homeowner's handyman) or outsourcing system
    administration tasks to an outside firm like an **Managed Service Provider** (commonly

- en: In the software development world, which is all engineering with no administration,
    the standard rule of thumb is that any interruption that requires an engineer's
    focus will cost that engineer the time of the interruption plus fifteen minutes
    additional time to get back to the point of productivity where they were before
    the interruption. It does not take much to see that a handful of interruptions
    throughout a day would reduce the effective time of an engineer to essentially
    zero. They might be attempting to work all day, sitting at their desk trying to
    focus on the task, burning through their available time, but if they keep getting
    interruption, they will just spin their wheels and feel more and more exhausted
    and disheartened as they do not get a chance to rest, but neither do they get
    to be productive and show something for their efforts.

    Administrators are, of course, impacted by the fifteen-minute rule just the same
    as an engineer is. But unlike the engineer, an administrator is normally resolving
    a problem, or a request and the worst is a small, atomic chunk that is completed
    before the next interruption takes focus. When a task is completed, or an outage
    resolved the next task to be tackled is a different one whether it is already
    lined up and ready to go or doesn't arrive for some time. The administrator must
    go through task switching between each issue regardless, so the overhead that
    this incurs is a given that cannot be avoided.

    the same role at another company our position can look like a completely different
    career path! It is easy to find system administrators who spend nearly their entire
    day manually deploying software and never, ever do performance tuning; another
    system administrator might do little other than performance tuning; another might
    focus on managing system applications or databases; one will manage lots of printers,
    but most admins will never manage even a single printer; and another managing
    users and userland storage concerns, while again, most, will never manage users
    at all. All of these system administrators may never meet another system administrator
    who does a similar workload to what they do, and few will ever get a second job
    within their field that has them do the same tasks again. Each system administration
    position is, effectively, unique. Almost absurdly so.

    devices. Do not casually dismiss the desktop administration subset of systems

    the comprehensive point of communications that must understand how the database
    is talking to storage, how storage is quiescing data, and how a backup is being

    learning is not a sustainable approach. Once you are working in the field you
    will not have the time to continuously take classes to keep your knowledge up
    to date, nor will you be able to find classes that provide for the immediate needs
    of the next project or challenge. Classroom learning is essentially a special
    case that is only available to people before they enter their careers. It is not
    a useful approach in an ongoing way. Because of this, learning through a classroom
    setting does not demonstrate a practical skill for the workplace.

    communities, and other self-starting means that show that you are able to learn
    without someone else's assistance are crucial both because you will almost never
    have someone available to know everything that you need to know before you do
    and be prepared to teach it to you, and because you will be spending your entire
    career constantly needing to stay current and learn new technologies and techniques.
    Any serious profession involves lifelong learning, but very few demands it to
    the degree that is required in IT. Showing the ability to teach yourself whatever
    is needed is a very big deal to a potential employer.

    on in your career and almost none of them require previous industry experience

    trade programs specifically target assisting students get their first industry
    certifications during high school. A motivated student could go far beyond what
    any normal school program could provide and quite quickly building a resume of
    both experience and certifications.

    started studying towards an IT career in middle school and stuck with it for four
    to six years, it would not be unreasonable to have gained more hands-on experience
    than many mid-career working adults. Not every business will be keen to hire someone
    so young regardless of what they can bring to the business, but we don't want
    *every job*, we want that *one* job and a business that is really serious about
    their IT is going to potentially view that candidate as being the most impressive.

    through an internship. Today this is much less common, yet it still exists. Most
    internships will be unpaid. Internships can be extremely valuable, especially
    for younger learners generally of high school or university age, because they
    can provide access to traditional businesses, rather than non-profits or charities,
    and should provide a mentor to guide you while learning. Even paid internships
    are assumed to be quite poorly paid making them quite difficult for someone beyond
    student ages to typically consider.

    offering internships do so believing that they are getting low-cost labor when
    the purpose of an internship is supposed to be to give back to the industry and
    community. In doing this we often see no mentoring or guidance. The intern is
    just used to do jobs that require no skill and teach them nothing. In companies
    that do at least attempt to treat an internship properly it is quite common for
    the company to lack the skill or resources to mentor and simply not be able to
    do so. Potentially the worst result is being mentored by someone who is not well
    trained themselves and the intern being taught incorrectly and coming out with
    fewer skills than when going in!

    Internships look great on a resume and even poor experiences can be used to make
    good talking points in an interview. If you were taught everything incorrectly,
    perhaps you can present a *what not to do* that was taught to you by example!
    Just be wary and do not think that all internships should be bad or involve doing
    menial labour or not being mentored. A true internship is about providing you
    an education via a mentor who is able to show you how the job is done in the real
    world. It is not an excuse to get cheap labor. That does not mean that you will
    never do any work in an internship. You very well may and getting your hands dirty
    in a real environment is part of the goal. But a true intern is there to learn
    and not to work *per se*.

    little else is as generally rewarding as working in IT. IT isn't just an enormous
    field with countless opportunities, but it is one that gives you geographic opportunity,
    the chance to explore any business market (finance, manufacturing, insurance,
    healthcare, veterinary, hospitality, research, government, military, journalist,
    media, software, tourism, marketing, and so on), and myriad different roles within
    the field. Everyone's IT journey is a unique one, and the chances for your career
    to be rewarding and exciting are higher than in nearly any other field. IT is
    uniquely positioned as not only a technical field, but also as a customer service
    field, but most importantly as a *core business function*. IT builds and maintains
    the business infrastructure. As such we are a key player in every aspect of the
    internals of an individual business, even before we consider the fact that we
    work in all businesses!

    about whiteboards, notepads, and just bringing good decision making and common
    sense to the organization. I often compare IT to legal and accounting departments:
    each has a focus, but each also is just *part of the business* itself.'

    it sounds great. Everyone wants to be called a professional. This aligns us with
    doctors, lawyers, civil engineers, and so forth. But the truth is, none of those
    are good analogues to what we do in IT. All those fields start with stringent
    certifications, follow exacting rules, and would be *just following the script*
    if their approaches were applied in IT. There is a reason that IT certifications
    are almost exclusively about products rather than roles, and that is because the
    concept of certifying someone for an IT role conceptually doesn't really make
    sense. Why is that?

    codify IT, you could automate IT, but you can't. IT is primarily creative and
    works as a business function more like the CEO than to any other department. IT's
    job is to maximize the profits of the business through improvements and good decision
    making in business infrastructure, which is an extremely broad mandate. The CEO
    has the same mandate, just without the limitation of being focused on the infrastructure.
    You would never certify someone as a *CEO Professional*, that's crazy. CEOs are
    totally creative, wild, unique. IT is the same way or should be. We would never
    accept a CEO that just did what everyone else did, there would be no value to
    them. Business professionals like the CEO or the IT department are there to take
    massive amounts of information and training; add common sense, experience, and
    creativity; and then apply all of that to a unique business in relationship to
    its customers, market, regulations, and competition. Almost nothing in these roles
    is repeatable on a large scale.

    thousand people, has the singular function of helping the company to maximize
    profits. To do that we have to understand the business inside and out, business
    as a general concept, technology, decision making, risk and reward, and so on.
    You can't make those kinds of business decisions, take those kinds of profit risks,
    if you are tied to the confines associated with *professionals*.

    centers around their *certification* process and their overall focus is all about
    *avoiding mistakes*. A doctor will prioritize any number of lives lost through
    inaction over being the direct cause of a death themselves. The *professional*
    approach is to avoid mistakes at the tactical level, while eschewing the strategic
    level.

    risk assessment, calculate potential reward, and make decisions that, mathematically,
    make sense for business profits. As IT *professionals*, it's not just okay to
    risk *losing a patient* from time to time, but if we never lose one, chances are
    pretty good that we are too risk averse to make good decisions. IT should never
    be about avoiding failure at all costs (or even just at irrational costs), but
    about choosing the level of risk that is dictated as wise based on the math and
    logic of the situation. For this reason, I often refer to those in our field as
    IT Practitioners because this better reflects the proper mindset that we should
    have when properly representing our field in a company that takes the role of
    the IT department seriously (and, by extension, takes itself seriously.)

    *we cannot have server downtime at any cost*. This comes up from the normal course
    of risk assessment and discovery. System engineers ask what the value of a system
    is so that they can gauge the needs of risk mitigation only to be told something
    like *downtime is not an option* or *we have to be up one hundred percent of the
    time, at any cost*.

    avoiding the question by stating something absurd. We are left with nothing to
    work with, no way to know how to approach system design. No system has zero chance
    of failure, that is not possible. Saying that we must protect against all possible
    failures *at any cost* means that to even attempt to fulfill that demand that
    we just consume literally all resources that the organization can provide purely
    for risk mitigation. Any IT department attempting to follow that directive with
    any sincerity would bankrupt the firm. It should be obvious that no workload,
    in any scenario, is worth that. Yet, it is surprisingly often that company management
    expects IT to work with little other direction in determining which workloads
    get what degree of protection.

    to become one of those roles with little or no training than to be an effective
    system administrator without that business training. IT roles at a decision making
    or influence level require so much business knowledge and practical business thinking
    to do the job in with any semblance of success that often we must act as advisors
