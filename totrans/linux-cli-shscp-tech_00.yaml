- en: '*Linux Command-Line and Shell Scripting Techniques* is a book that will help
    you learn how to use the **Command-Line Interface** (**CLI**) and to further expand
    your CLI knowledge with the ability to do scripting. It looks at a big collection
    of CLI commands, shell scripting basics (loops, variables, and functions), and
    advanced scripting topics – such as troubleshooting. It also includes two chapters
    with script examples that should get you further ahead in your understanding of
    scripting while also offering good insight into how the shell scripting process
    works.'

- en: This book is for beginners and professionals alike, as it doesn't necessarily
    need a lot of prior Linux knowledge. That's partially what this book is for –
    to get to grips with using the command line and to further that usage model to
    shell scripting. For more advanced users, there's a bulk of content about shell
    scripting and corresponding examples that will help you to organize and improve
    your knowledge about shell scripting.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B16269_01_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor012), *Basics of the
    Shell and Text Terminal*, discusses the concept of the shell and text terminal,
    configuration of the Bash shell, using some basic shell commands, and using the
    screen to get access to multiple virtual terminals in text mode.'

    Editors*, takes us to the highly subjective world of text editors, where discussions
    have been happening for the past 30-40 years on the topic of *best editor*. As
    a part of this chapter, we''re going to use vi(m), nano, and some more advanced
    vi(m) settings.'

    and Services for Process Management*, is about using files, folders, and services,
    specifically, how to administer them, how to secure them (files and folders),
    and how to manage them (services). A big chunk of this chapter is related to ACLs
    and systemctl, essential tools for system administrators.'

- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B16269_04_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor077), *Using Shell
    to Configure and Troubleshoot Network*, is all about working with files, folders,
    and services – working with permissions, manipulating file content, archiving
    and compressing files, and managing services. Throughout this chapter, there will
    be a lot of simple commands that we will be using later when we go on to scripting,
    as well.'

- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B16269_05_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105), *Using Commands
    for File, Directory, and Service Management*, is about making sure that we know
    the basics of fundamental networking configuration – nmcli and netplan, FirewallD
    and ufw, DNS resolving, and diagnostics. These are some of the settings that we
    most commonly re-configure post-deployment, so deep insight into them is a necessity.'

- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B16269_06_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138), *Shell-Based
    Software Management*, takes us through two of the most commonly used packaging
    systems (`dnf/yum` and `apt`), as well as some more advanced concepts, such as
    using additional repositories, streams, and profiles, creating custom repositories,
    and third-party software. Every Linux deployment needs us to have knowledge about
    package management, so this chapter is all about that.'

- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B16269_07_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor160), *Network-Based
    File Synchronization*, teaches us about the most commonly used tools to send and
    receive files and connect to remote destinations via a network – `ssh and scp,
    rsync, and vsftpd`. For anything ranging from hosting a Linux distribution mirror
    all the way to synchronizing files and backups, this is mandatory knowledge.'

    Line to Find, Extract, and Manipulate Text Content,* is all about using basic
    and more advanced ways of manipulating text files and content. We start off by
    doing simple things such as `paste and dos2unix`, and then move on to some of
    the most used commands in the IT world – `cut,` (`e`)`grep, and sed`.'

    to Shell Scripting*, is the starting point for the second part of this book, which
    is all about shell scripting and using previously mentioned tools and commands
    to create shell scripts. This chapter is about the basics of shell scripting and
    working with general concepts, such as input, output, error, and shell script
    hygiene.'

- en: '[*Chapter 10*](B16269_10_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor225), *Using Loops*,
    goes deep into the concept of loops. We cover all the most used loops here – the
    `for` loop, `break` and `continue`, the `while` loop, the test-if loop, the `case`
    loop, and logical looping with conditions such as `and`, `or`, and `not`. This
    will further enhance our ability to do more things in shell scripts.'

- en: '[*Chapter 11*](B16269_11_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor256), *Working with
    Variables*, is about using variables in our shell script code – shell variables,
    quoting and special characters in variable values, assigning external variables
    via commands, as well as some logical operations on variables. Variables are the
    spine of shell scripting, and all permanent and temporary data gets stored in
    them, so, for whatever purpose we''re developing a shell script, variables are
    a must-have.'

- en: '[*Chapter 12*](B16269_12_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor283), *Using Arguments
    and Functions*, is about further customizing and modularizing the shell script
    code, as we can use functions to do that. For that purpose, we are going to use
    external and shell arguments, to do away with the static nature of most of our
    previous shell script examples.'

- en: '[*Chapter 13*](B16269_13_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor316), *Using Arrays*,
    is about using arrays to store and manipulate data. Arrays are just one of those
    structures – we need them, we learn to not necessarily like them, but we can''t
    live without them, especially as we venture into the world of working with their
    many different capabilities, such as indexing, adding and removing members, and
    working with files as a de facto array source.'

- en: '[*Chapter 14*](B16269_14_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor328), *Interacting
    with Shell Scripts*, is about moving from the idea of shell script code as a purely
    text-driven principle, and going in the opposite direction – to create a TUI-based
    interface to interact with a script. We are also going to have a play with `expect`
    script, which makes it easier for us to create a script that''s waiting for specific
    output and then doing something based on that output, which can be useful for
    the configuration of third-party systems at times.'

- en: '[*Chapter 15*](B16269_15_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor345), *Troubleshooting
    Shell Scripts*, deals with shell script troubleshooting – common mistakes, debugging
    output via echoing values during script execution, Bash `-xv`, and other concepts.
    This is the last chapter before we start dealing with the many script examples
    that we prepared for you to use both as a learning tool and to work with them
    in production, if you so desire.'

    Examples for Server Management, Network Configuration, and Backups*, sets us off
    in the direction of simple shell scripts – nine different examples to be exact.
    Topics vary from simple, modular code that can be implemented in any shell script
    (for example, how to check if we''re executing a script as root), to more complex
    examples such as dealing with date and time, the interactive configuration of
    network settings and firewalls, as well as some backup script examples.'

- en: '[*Chapter 17*](B16269_17_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor404), *Advanced Shell
    Script Examples*, deals with more complex examples, such as a script to modify
    web server and security settings, bulk-creating users and groups with random passwords,
    scripted KVM virtual machine installation, and scripted KVM virtual machine administration
    (start, stop, getting info, manipulating snapshots, and so on). These are examples
    that we use in everyday life to drive the point of shell scripting home, which
    is all about automating boring, repetitive tasks and offloading them to a script
    that can do all of that for us.'
