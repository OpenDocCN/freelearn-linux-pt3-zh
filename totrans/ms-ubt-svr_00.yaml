- en: Linux is an exciting platform. You can literally find it everywhere—desktops,
    laptops, phones, embedded appliances, and especially servers. Linux servers power
    many famous technologies around the world, and have a massive presence in physical
    and cloud server environments. Linux servers are scalable, stable, and powerful.

    created a kernel as a school project. He created the Linux kernel. And little
    did he know at the time, Linux would see us through some of the most exciting
    innovations in infrastructure design. Things like multicore processors, virtualization,
    containerization, and cloud computing (to name a few) have transformed data centers
    all over the world. And Linux has been a part of all of those advancements.

    adoption of Linux. Ever since its first release back in 2004, Ubuntu has made
    Linux more approachable for newcomers, while simultaneously offering powerful
    features to server administrators. Ubuntu can be found on notebooks and workstations,
    in addition to servers.

    available servers that empower organizations with the power of open source. As
    Ubuntu administrators, we’re in good company—according to W3Techs, Ubuntu is the
    most widely deployed distribution on the web with regard to Linux. With the release
    of Ubuntu 22.04, this platform becomes even more exciting!

    the concepts needed to manage your servers and configure them to perform all kinds
    of neat tasks, such as serving web pages, managing virtual machines, running containers,
    automating configuration, sharing files with other users, and even running Ubuntu
    in the cloud.

    installation of Ubuntu Server 22.04, which will serve as a foundation for the
    rest of the book. As we proceed through our journey, we’ll look at managing users,
    connecting to networks, and controlling processes. Later, we’ll implement important
    technologies, such as DHCP, DNS, Apache, MariaDB, and more. We’ll even set up
    our own Nextcloud server along the way.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for readers who already have some experience with Linux, though
    it doesn’t necessarily have to be with Ubuntu. Preferably, the reader will understand
    basic Linux command-line skills, such as changing directories, listing contents,
    and issuing commands as regular users or with root. It’s also preferred that the
    reader understands foundational networking concepts, such as the purpose of things
    like DHCP, DNS, as well as IP addressing. Even if you feel as though you need
    a refresher, you should read this book anyway—the opening chapters will cover
    many of these concepts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, we’ll take a look at real-world situations in which we can deploy
    Ubuntu Server. This will include the installation process, serving web pages,
    setting up databases, and much more. Specifically, the goal here is to be productive.
    Each chapter will teach the reader a new and valuable concept, using practical
    examples that are relative to real organizations. Basically, we focus on getting
    things done, rather than focusing primarily on theory. Although the theory that
    goes into Linux and its many distributions is certainly interesting, the goal
    here is to get you to the point where if a work colleague or client asks you to
    perform work on an Ubuntu-based server, you’ll be in a good position to get the
    task done. Therefore, if your goal is to get up and running with Ubuntu Server
    and learn the concepts that really matter, this book is definitely for you.

    a virtual Ubuntu instance from a cloud provider, or a laptop or desktop capable
