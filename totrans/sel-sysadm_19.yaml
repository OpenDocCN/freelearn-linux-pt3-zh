- en: While the reference policy is the most frequently used language and development
    style for SELinux policies, the **Common Intermediate Language** (**CIL**) is
    a powerful, but more low-level language construct to use to develop SELinux policies.
    Low-level as it might be though, it is still very much readable and well supported,
    as SELinux tools will use CIL under the hood when using other languages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since CIL is the main language used, we know it can be used to build entire
    policies. Sadly, there are no supporting constructs available for developers to
    use, unlike the reference policy. However, we can still learn how to customize
    the current policy, creating specific definitions that are not possible with the
    more common reference policy, and even build a complete application policy if
    we choose.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CIL has been designed to be the main language to have policies built in, and
    is the lowest readable format. After CIL, the SELinux code is transformed in binary
    to send off to the Linux kernel (and SELinux subsystem) for loading in memory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Administrators might be inclined to think that the binary files, generated when
    building a SELinux policy module using the reference policy method, are the final
    binaries. However, as we've seen in [*Chapter 1*](B16276_01_Final_VK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor018),
    *Fundamental SELinux Concepts*, the `semodule` command converts and translates
    this into CIL before building the final format.

    to first consider the module as an unknown format, and extract the `.pp` files
    are supported as an HLL.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the other classic SELinux development) is the same as the module generated, this
    phase often just involves creating a copy. We can see this when we compare an

    will be converted into CIL anyway. The resulting CIL code, however, does not have
    any facilitating constructions inside. For instance, all permissions are expanded,
    and all interactions with other resources or types outside of the SELinux policy
    module are listed as well. There are no longer any supporting macros or interfaces.
    In the *Building complete application policies* section, we'll see that CIL does
    support abstractions, so the current observation is only due to the translation
    that the `pp` command performs.

    not be addressed properly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To work around this issue, a default attribute called `cil_gen_require` is used.
    When types or roles are assigned to the `cil_gen_require` attribute, they are
    automatically linked correctly in the policy. This is not a CIL requirement though,
    but a convention that the SELinux utilities use.

    are going to use made part of the `cil_gen_require` attribute, and to use attributes
    as much as possible to simplify development activities. Rather than granting all
    possible `allow` rules to each and every domain that can interact with your policy
    resources, grant them to an attribute, and then assign this attribute to the domains.
    This creates a much smaller policy and is easier to maintain.

    that we cannot add in a SELinux module—at least not when using the traditional
    or reference policy style coding. When we want to use these, we need to rebuild
    the entire policy and make the adjustments in the so-called base policy; the main
    and first policy loaded before the modules are added. This, however, requires
    access to the full SELinux policy sources and a process to use them (as you will
    overwrite the Linux distribution's SELinux policy and should make sure that any
    system update does not overwrite your policy again).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    statements. This statement is documented on [https://selinuxproject.org/page/NetworkStatements](https://selinuxproject.org/page/NetworkStatements),

    existing rules.
  prefs: []

    rules that we don't like. Constraints are not visible in regular policy queries,
    as with `sesearch`. Administrators might be very confused when `sesearch` indicates
    that an action is allowed while the system is refusing to allow it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With CIL, we can add constraints to a live policy to do exactly that. Keep in
    mind though that constraints don't actually allow anything – they merely put limits
    on what the SELinux subsystem will see as a valid action. A constraint statement
    that supports reading any possible type does not actually allow this, as there
    still need to be type enforcement rules in place to actually allow these actions.

    dot prefix is not mandatory if there is no possible collision. If no local definition

    SELinux policies as we have within the reference policy, and even more as there
    are many constraints not applicable to CIL policies.

- en: The current reference policy has a significant amount of code in it, which would
    all need to be reworked. Furthermore, Linux distributions have extended this policy
    with many of their own additions, so the work needed to rewrite the SELinux policy
    code into CIL is significant. Not impossible, but not a feat to accomplish in
    a few weeks.

- en: Almost all of the information and documentation online that helps developers
    in writing SELinux policies is based upon the current reference policy. This major
    source of information would become stale the moment a switch occurs, and the amount
    of documentation available online for CIL-based policy development is still pretty
    slim.

- en: The CIL policy, while very powerful, is also a bit more complex due to its S-expressions.
    The design intention of CIL was not to replace SELinux policy development with
    CIL, but to allow higher level languages to be developed that translate and convert
    into CIL easily. Hence, if a rework is going to be done anyway, it is much more
    likely that a user- and development-friendly language will be designed that can
    be easily converted into CIL.

    terms of user space and kernel support, we can expect more additions to be added
    to CIL and to its supporting tools.

- en: 'CIL for SELinux is a powerful, lower-level syntax and language that is used
    to express all possible SELinux policy code. The SELinux userspace utilities will
    automatically convert existing policies into CIL code, but through this conversion,
    a lot of CIL constructs are not used: the conversion only uses a smaller set of
    CIL capabilities to establish a valid translation.'

- en: The more advanced CIL capabilities, such as namespace support, macros, and the
    permission sets through the `classpermissionset` statement, are useful when developing
    our own, CIL-based SELinux policies. In this chapter, we've learned how to use
    CIL to build complete application policies. Because there is no reference policy-like
    framework to simplify development, we had to write all of the necessary code constructs
    ourselves.

- en: While this means that developing CIL-based policies is more resource intensive,
    we did also see that CIL has a few benefits that reference policy-style development
    cannot deal with, such as the ability to declare ports or add SELinux constraints
    to an active policy.

    more widely used, but we will notice continuous improvements within SELinux on
    this matter in the foreseeable future.

    it is only the start of a journey, not the end. SELinux is a widely used technology,
    and we hope that this book provides you with the right material and knowledge
    to understand, grow, and contribute to the ecosystem. Thank you for your interest
    and your dedication.
