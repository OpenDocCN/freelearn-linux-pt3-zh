- en: Ubuntu Linux is one of a number of variants (also referred to as distributions)
    of the Linux operating system and is the product of a U.K. company named Canonical
    Ltd. The company was founded in 1994 by Mark Shuttleworth. The origins of Linux,
    however, go back even further. This chapter will outline the history of both the
    Linux operating system and Ubuntu.

- en: Linux is an operating system in much the same way that Windows is an operating
    system (and there any similarities between Linux and Windows end). The term operating
    system is used to describe the software that acts as a layer between the hardware
    in a computer and the applications that we all run on a daily basis. When programmers
    write applications, they interface with the operating system to perform such tasks
    as writing files to the hard disk drive and displaying information on the screen.
    Without an operating system, every programmer would have to write code to access
    the hardware of the system directly. In addition, the programmer would have to
    be able to support every single piece of hardware ever created to be sure the
    application would work on every possible hardware configuration. Because the operating
    system handles all of this hardware complexity, application development becomes
    a much easier task. Linux is just one of a number of different operating systems
    available today.

- en: To understand the history of Linux, we first have to go back to AT&T Bell Laboratories
    in the late 1960s. During this time, AT&T had discontinued involvement in developing
    a new operating system named Multics. However, two AT&T engineers, Ken Thompson,
    and Dennis Ritchie, decided to take what they had learned from the Multics project
    and create a new operating system named UNIX which quickly gained popularity and
    wide adoption both with corporations and academic institutions.

    those created by IBM (AIX), Hewlett-Packard (HP-UX), and Sun Microsystems (SunOS
    and Solaris). In addition, a UNIX-like operating system named MINIX was created
    by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and designed for educational use with source code access
    provided to universities.

- en: The origins of Linux can be traced back to the work and philosophies of two
    people. At the heart of the Linux operating system is something called the kernel.
    This is the core set of features necessary for the operating system to function.
    The kernel manages the system’s resources and handles communication between the
    hardware and the applications. The Linux kernel was developed by Linus Torvalds,
    who, taking a dislike to MS-DOS and impatient for the availability of MINIX for
    the new Intel 80386 microprocessor, decided to write his own UNIX-like kernel.
    When he had finished the first version of the kernel, he released it under an
    open-source license that enabled anyone to download the source code and freely
    use and modify it without having to pay Linus any money.

- en: Around the same time, Richard Stallman at the Free Software Foundation, a strong
    advocate of free and open-source software, was working on an open-source operating
    system of his own. Rather than focusing initially on the kernel, however, Stallman
    began by developing open-source versions of all the UNIX tools, utilities, and
    compilers necessary to use and maintain an operating system. By the time he had
    finished developing this infrastructure, the obvious solution was to combine his
    work with the kernel Linus had written to create a complete operating system.
    This combination became known as GNU/Linux. Purists insist that Linux always be
    referred to as GNU/Linux (in fact, at one time, Richard Stallman refused to give
    press interviews to any publication which failed to refer to Linux as GNU/Linux).
    This is not unreasonable, given that the GNU tools developed by the Free Software
    Foundation make up a significant and vital part of GNU/Linux. Unfortunately, most
    people and publications refer to Linux as Linux, which will probably always continue
    to be the case.

    source code that makes up the Ubuntu distribution originates from a highly regarded
    Linux distribution known as Debian, created by Ian Murdoch.

- en: A South African internet mogul named Mark Shuttleworth (who made his fortune
    selling his company to VeriSign for around $500 million) decided it was time for
    a more user-friendly Linux. He took the Debian distribution and worked to make
    it a more human-friendly distribution which he called Ubuntu. He subsequently
    formed a company called Canonical Ltd to promote and provide support for Ubuntu.

    distribution, it is unlikely you will find a better option than Ubuntu.

- en: The word “Ubuntu” is an ancient Zulu and Xhosa word that means “humanity to
    others”. Ubuntu also means “I am what I am because of who we all are”. It was
    chosen because these sentiments precisely describe the spirit of the Ubuntu distribution.

    of a wide range of different Linux distributions. One such distribution is Ubuntu,
