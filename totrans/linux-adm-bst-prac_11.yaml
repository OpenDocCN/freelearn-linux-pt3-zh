    I think that most people would feel like this is the *potatoes*. In this chapter
    we are going to be dealing with all of the parts of system administration that
    no one can see on our servers. These are those nearly invisible components of
    our jobs that are so critical and can do so much to separate the juniors from
    the seniors; the extra steps that make all of the difference when things start
    to go wrong.

    everyone talks about it, and almost no one does it or if they do, they don't keep
    it up to date. Documentation is boring, often harder than it seems to do well,
    and because almost no management will ever follow up and verify it, extremely
    easy to ignore. No one ever gets promoted because of excellent documentation,
    no one throws documentation parties, and no one talks about it on their curriculum
    vitae. Documentation just is not cool enough for people to want to spend time
    talking about.

    how systems work and what tasks need to be done to them. It allows us to hand
    off tasks to others. It protects the business should we go on vacation, get sick,

    writing the functions that they test has become popular and has shown that it
    can force people to think differently about how they approach problem solving
    and can lead to greater efficiency. We have very similar benefits in system administration.
    Approaching documentation more aggressively can lead to faster processes, better
    planning, less wasted time, and fewer mistakes. Taking a documentation-first approach,
    that is writing documentation before systems are built or configured, can help
    us think differently about our system designs and to document thoroughly: An intentional
    process of documenting what should be, rather than attempting to document what
    we did. This provides a wholly different way of thinking, and a way to double
    verify veracity, and an actual process to encourage completeness of documentation.'

  zh: 在软件工程领域，编写测试用例再编写要测试的功能这一新技术已变得流行，并且证明它能够促使人们以不同的方式思考如何解决问题，从而提高效率。在系统管理中，我们也有类似的好处。更积极地进行文档编写能带来更快的流程、更好的规划、更少的时间浪费和更少的错误。采取“文档优先”的方法，即在系统构建或配置之前先编写文档，能帮助我们以不同的方式思考系统设计，并进行充分的文档记录：这是一个有意识的文档编写过程，目的是记录应该做的事情，而不是记录我们做过的事情。这提供了一种完全不同的思维方式，一种验证真实性的方式，以及一种促进文档完整性的实际过程。

    we can improve our chances of having accurate and complete data. Avoiding the
    need to go back and attempt to remember everything that was needed or done on
    a system is important. Using a document first process we have an opportunity to
    catch missed documentation at the time that we go to use it, which may only be
    a few minutes later. If we work first and then document it, it is very easy to
    forget small details and there is no triggering event to remind us to verify that
    something is written. Alternatively, if we document first, we have the moment
    when we need to put data into a system or a configuration to make. We have a triggering
    event, the actual moment of entering configuration data to remind us that we should
    have pulled that out of a document. It is not foolproof, only more reliable than
    typical processes.

    needed or that it is one of the most important things that we can do working as
    system administrators, or really working in information technology at all. It
    is practically a mantra that we repeat, yet few of us really internalize this
    decision. Instead, we pay lip service to the ideology of documenting everything
    and still push off documentation as a secondary concern that we might do tomorrow
    if, and only if, we get bored during some mythical free time. This is where things

    us to avoid it or to see it as too time consuming to do at the correct time. If
    we make documentation fast and easy, we are much more likely to find ourselves
    just doing it, perhaps even enjoying it to some degree. I know that I am personally

    modified by multiple people at the same time. Their simplistic design often assumes
    that they will be treated quite simply - a single author, as the only reader,
    during the time of edits. This makes a wiki more useful in single user environments,
    or environments where users rarely use the documentation platform at the same
    time, or in organizations where different users tend to be segmented off from
    one another so that they will use different documentation pages at different times.

    start over. Look over your options, think about how your company will need to
    approach documentation and collaboration and pick an approach. It does not even
    have to be the right one. Any documentation process is good, even if you risk
    having to do it again. Pick a system and try it out. See if it fits the style

    it allows for the style of collaboration (if any) that your business needs.

    and ensure that data exists only one time, in a single, predictable place. Think
    of your documentation like a relational database that needs some normalization,
    and the first major step is organization and the second is removing redundancy.
    Documentation is always hard to maintain, and redundancy of data makes it all

    the system performance, and the overall reliability. Every small change makes
    everything else change with it. No piece can be decided upon individually, let

    large enough in capacity, or fast enough for the workload to function; and more

    we will spend $20,000 today. Or to get a server that we project will last us for
    four years, we might spend $8,000 today. A big difference. Of course, this is

    time is hard to overstate. First there is often hard cost savings because of the
    nature of server pricing means that buying less, more often simply costs less
    because of the price benefits that happen within the operational lifespan of a
    modern server. And then there is the time-value of money that says that spending
    the same amount of money, but delaying spending it, means that you have more money
    to make you money in the interim and that the same money that you spend in the
    future is worth less than that money today. Then there is newer technology - if
    we wait for years to buy a new server we potentially get a lot of newer technology
    in that server that can contribute not only to capacity advantages, but also lower
    power consumption, great durability, and so forth.

  zh: 购买更少、更短时间内使用的设备的优点是无法过分强调的。首先，由于服务器定价的特点，购买更少的设备、更加频繁地更换往往能节省硬性成本，因为现代服务器的运营生命周期内，会发生一些价格上的优惠。接着是货币的时间价值理论，这意味着如果你花费相同金额的钱，但推迟了支出，你就可以在此期间用这笔钱赚取更多的钱，而且未来你所花的钱，其价值比今天的钱要少。最后，还有更新的技术——如果我们等几年再购买新的服务器，我们可能会得到更多更新的技术，不仅能提升容量，还能带来更低的能耗、更好的耐用性等优势。
- en: Then the advantage of having two servers. We assume that the second server is
    going to replace the first, and maybe it will. But we might also use the purchase
    to simply expand capacity, the first might remain in production service. If we
    are replacing the first server, it may be redeployed in another role within the
    organization or could be used as a backup server for the new one. Almost always
    you will be able to find a highly effective use for the original investment.

- en: Most likely the biggest advantage is in delayed decision making. By holding
    off spending much of our initial budget by several years we get the flexibility
    to invest that money at any time, or never. Instead of doing an eight-year projection,
    which is wildly inaccurate to the point of being totally useless, we do two four-year
    projections, which are still pretty inaccurate, but the degree to which they are
    more accurate is pretty crazy. At our first four-year checkpoint we get to evaluate
    how good our last projection was and make a new one based on this new data and
    new starting point. We not only get to do a fresh evaluation of our own organization
    with four more years of insight, but also four more years of insight on the industry,
    and four more years of new technology. Very few businesses would make the same
    decisions in four years that they would make today. In business, delayed decision
    making of this nature can be astronomically beneficial.

    there are political benefits to making people feel good and showing faith in the
    business or its leadership; and it just makes us feel good to think about all
    of the success that we are surely going to experience. And better projections
    normally means more clout, bigger budgets, more to work with for many years to
    come. Almost no business ever goes back and evaluates past projections to see
    if people did a good job, so there are rewards for being overly optimistic and
    generally zero risk of retribution if they are falsified for personal gain (emotional,
    financial, or political.) This system makes projections very dangerous and anything
    that we can do to reduce our dependency on them is important.

    happily cache outrageous amounts of storage into memory to improve database performance

    impact on database performance. Because of this, just measuring memory utilization
    can be very tricky. How much *useful* memory are we using? Storage is easier,
    but similar challenges can exist. CPU is the easiest, but nothing is ever completely

    not tell us how well they are needed.

    For one company, or set of workloads, this might mean that we can put twice as
    many workloads on this system to get its utilization close to up to one hundred
    percent. For another company, or set of workloads, it might mean that we have
    overloaded the system and there is enough context switching and wait times that
    some applications are noticing latency. It is not uncommon for companies to target
    ninety percent utilization as a loose average, but for others targeting just ten
    percent can be required.

    CPU cycles means that the CPU could be doing more tasks, but if a CPU is tied
    up doing tasks all of the time then it is not necessarily available if a new task
    is suddenly presented to it. If you are working with low latency systems, having
    available system resources at the ready to process that task at the time that
    it is first presented can be a requirement. In order to assess capacity use and
    needs for systems requires us to deeply understand not just how much of the system
    is being used, but what that ultimately means for our workloads.

    rule. More practical, in most circumstances, is to develop and track baselines
    over time. This generally means doing some sort of activity where you record measurements,
    as well as recording what you can about end user application performance, of the
    system so that you can look back and see what system utilization has been. This
    data should be collected over long periods of time. Weeks or months, at least
    sometimes, to find hot spots and cold spots. Common cold spots might be Sunday
    overnight when many applications are not used at all. A common hot spot is month-end

    The real leap in log management happens when we introduce central log collection.
    This is really where the logging revolution has taken place. Of course, even going
    back decades, the potential and tools for basic log aggregation existed. This
    can be as simple as using network copy commands or network mapped drives to store
    the same old text files on a central file server. So the fundamental idea of central
    logging is not new.

    Later it was performance and storage issues. Centralizing logs used a lot of network
    bandwidth and required a lot of storage capacity and, in some cases, was a performance
    nightmare for the log server as well. Those days are long since in the past. Today
    all of those things are trivialized simply by the natural leaps in capacity and
    performance of all aspects of our systems with far smaller growth in log size
    and complexity. Logs today are not all that much larger than they were decades
    ago.

    Large amounts of aggregated log data presents big challenges for most systems
    as they need to be able to continue to ingest large amounts of real time data
    from many sources while simultaneously being able to recall and display that data.

- en: Modern central logging applications all use new, modern databases designed around
    this time of data flow and storage. No one single type of database is used for
    this, but many newer databases excel at handling these needs allowing data traditionally
    stored as large, unwieldy text files to be reduced to much smaller and more efficient
    database items with metadata, caching, collation, and other features that allow
    for the ingestion of massively larger amounts of data than ever before while being
    able to continue to display data effectively. This change, along with the general
    improvements in system power, has made for effective centralized logging not only
    on the LAN, but in many cases, even for and to servers running hosted, in the
    cloud, or otherwise not sitting on a traditional LAN.

    in log reading. One (or at least fewer) places to go to read logs means that system
    administrators are looking at logs much faster than before and faster log reading
    means faster solutions. By having logs from many servers, systems, applications,
    and more all in a single place also means that we can correlate data between these
    systems without requiring humans to look at logs from multiple sources and make
    these connections manually.

    been unable to detect before. If multiple computers suddenly show a spike in log
    traffic maybe applications have suddenly become busy, or maybe there is a failure
    or attack underway. Centralized logging tools make it easier not only for us to
    understand what a baseline looks like for a single system, but what a baseline
    will look like for all of our systems combined! More layers of system understanding.

    logs is not new and even the United States government was putting rules in place
    for it by 2005\. But for many businesses, log automation is far beyond their current
    plans or capacity.

    logs across many systems at once to look for malicious activity.

    it tends to be so costly to implement, it is easy to question the value to centralizing
    logging to a single server, or group of servers, rather than simply leaving logs
    on individual hosts and finding better methods of examining logs from them. This
    is a very valid question. Of course, central logging is not going to be right

    that the data is not tied to the device. If a device dies, goes offline, or that

    want one person to be working on getting a failed server back up and running simultaneously
    while another scours logs to determine what led up to the failure or possibly
    determine what is needed to restore services.

    or storage systems will be compromised along with it. In fact this is generally
    quite likely. Modifying logs to cover up a compromise is very common with sophisticated
    attacks and simply deleting logs common in simpler ones. In most cases logs are
    attacked because they are the most likely place to easily identify that a compromise
    has happened or is happening and what to do to mitigate it. If the logs never
    show any signs of an attack, you may easily never discover that one has happened.

    to a remote logging server in real time then we have the logs stored separately
    from both the application and the server storage with an air gap so that, in order
    to modify those logs, a completely unrelated system has to also be compromised,
    without being detected. This is orders of magnitude more difficult to do, especially
    as the existence of and information about any external logging system will generally
    not be known until a compromise is already under way at which point it may already
    be too late to avoid detection.

    are completely controlled by the same system administrator (presumably you) that
    controls the server then it is trivial to make major modifications and hide the
    evidence of those changes. If the logs are sent to an external system to which
    we are not the administrator then it is much harder for us to hide those changes
    as we must prevent them from being logged in the first place while not causing
    the logging itself to fail.

    platform rather than running their own. In this way all of the necessary system

    generally be using some form of external support vendor and that vendor would,

    going back more than a few years, it was common for systems to handle their own
    alerts individually. Systems were already set to log issues into a central log,
    it was a natural extension to have them also send out emails or similar notifications
    should something bad be detected. Alerting was very simple, and each system would
    handle its own detection and its own alerting individually. While centralized
    monitoring and alerting has long existed, the popularity of external monitoring
    really did not become highly mainstreamed until it was necessary to monitor hosted
    Internet resources, such as websites, where an outage would often be seen by customers
    first, rather than by employees. When outages are first noticed by internal staff,
    the decision to delay discovery can be more flexible.

    or those that can risk slower error detection it can serve well. The key issues
    with on-device alerting are that many types of serious outages or attacks may
    disable alerting completely, or at least delay it. A simple example is the server
    that loses power or whose CPU melts, the system going offline is what we want
    to receive an alert about, but the system going offline suddenly precludes the
    possibility of the system telling anyone that something bad has happened. The
    same happens when there is a sudden loss of network connectivity. In the event
    of a system compromise, a hacker may take alerting capabilities offline before
    being detected leaving a system running, but unable to call out for help.

    a loss of functionality, it can be adequate.

    has failed, power has been lost, software has crashed, or networking has been
    lost, as examples. These are all common failure cases, and all either certainly
    or likely will cause on-device alerting to fail. External alerts give us a level

    And of course, by having only a single alert source, it is easy for us to simply
    check that source as humans to verify that it is working. An external alert mechanism,
    if decoupled from the systems that it monitors, is extremely unlikely to fail
    at the same time that another system fails and while not perfect, this will easily
    eliminate 99.99% or more of missed alerts which, for most organizations, is plenty.

    server, though. This means that it still has limited ability to monitor a system
    for certain types of common failures. As with many things, for many businesses
    this might be adequate, for others it will not be enough.

- en: Alerting systems also have two basic ways of interacting with us, as the actors
    being alerted by the system. What we tend to think of is pushed alerts. That is,
    alerts that are sent to us with the intention of grabbing our attention when we
    are not thinking about alerts.
  id: totrans-209

- en: Typically pushed alerts go out via email, text messages (SMS), telephone calls,
    WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, RocketChat, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoho Cliq, MatterMost,
    or other, similar, real-time communications channel. Some alerting systems have
    their own applications that you install to desktops or smartphones so that they
    can push out alerts rapidly and reliably without having to integrate or depend
    on any additional infrastructure. You can easily imagine an organization running
    their own email and messaging platforms only to have those platforms be monitored
    by our alert system and also be the path by which we receive the alerts. Even
    if the alerting system itself does not fail, it is possible that it will be unable
    to tell us that something has failed because the systems that it monitors are
    also the systems that get the alerts to us. This is why having one fewer path
    to fail and one fewer dependency in alert delivery is sometimes approached.

    humans, rather than computers, we would quickly find that call centers have complex,
    multi-branch decision trees to follow for what to do when we cannot tell someone
    that something is wrong. With humans, though, we know that in an extreme emergency
    someone will start pulling out their personal cell phone and texting someone to
    call someone and knock on a door and wake someone up or whatever. Computers can
    do all of this, too, but they need access to those tools, algorithms to make those
    decisions, and knowledge of how to reach people. Easier said that done.

    communications path. An expensive, but effective, tool. Sometimes human decision
    making, and flexibility wins out. Human call centers that are always staffed and
    receive alerts on behalf of technical teams and managers and then manage the contact
    path to whomever needs to receive the alert can be a great option. And, obviously,
    hybrid options where computer systems alert end recipients directly but humans
    are always involved in verifying that alerts go out, acknowledgements are received,
    or whatever is possible.

    systems that display the status of any open or logged alerts when the end user
    logs in to look at them. These systems are vastly more reliable because the end
    user is looking at the system and knows if there is an inability to view the alert
    status or not. If the system has failed, then they can start working on the issue
    right away. If it has not failed, they see the alerts and know if action is needed
    or not.

    you have been missing call after call, voicemail after voicemail, text after text

    like email and SMS texting will confirm only that a message has been sent or possibly
    received by the recipient's infrastructure vendor, but they do not give any indication
    that the message has made it all of the way to the end user's device, or that
    the end user has been displayed the message. Even if a message does go end to
    end, does it get filtered into a spam folder and hidden? Unless we have a human
    actually acknowledge an alert there is very little, we can do to have confidence
    that an alert has truly been seen.

    we picture as a red light, green light system. It is common to display monitored
    systems or components graphically and to show systems believed to be healthy shown
    as green, those experiencing problems, but not yet indicating an outage as yellow,
    and those that have failed whatever sensor test we are performing as red. This
    does not just give the humans the ability to quickly eyeball the range of alerts,
    but also makes it trivial for the system to roll up large groups of alerts into
    single displays. As long as those are green, you know everything in the group
    is healthy. If it is red, you can dig in to see exactly what is wrong. At the
    highest level you can, in theory, even have a single big indicator that shows
    as green or red. Green if systems are one hundred percent good and red if any
    system has failed. Simply: is action needed or is it not. If you can be green
    most of the time, this might be exactly what you need to combine reliable monitoring
    with low overhead in verification.'

    push notifications to improve response times and reach people who are not actively
    checking alerts. Pulled alert systems are often used at the core of a call center
    where humans on shifts watch the pulled alerts around the clock and either enact
    the push alerts to the concerned parties or follow up to ensure delivery of automated
    alerts. It is less common for organizations to open pulled alerts to many staff
    which can be a mistake as it can lower stress and increase alert reliability.

    that are being monitored can work in either direction or both. The monitoring
    system may have remote access to the end points and actively reach out to them
    to request their status. Or an agent running on the end points may reach out to
    the monitoring server to push their status over to it.

- en: Monitoring and alerting are, in some ways, two separate pieces and there is
    software and services that do either, and those that do both. The monitoring component
    determines if a series of sensors detects something that is wrong in our workloads.
    The alerting component takes the results of the monitoring and attempts to notify
    the correct parties. It used to be that the two components were always merged
    into single products, but in more recent years with more and more types of systems
    needing to be monitored (more than IT systems, that is) and as alerting needs
    have increased and have needed to become more robust, different vendors have started
    to build each independently in some cases.

    your primary infrastructure as you want it be less quick and reliable, and more
    totally independent of your other systems compared to other workloads. You can
    host it yourself on your own equipment, go with third party cloud or VPS hosted
    infrastructure, or get a SaaS application from a provider. You can tackle this
    in any manner than makes sense for your organization. But rarely do you want your
    monitoring solution to sit on the same hardware, let alone the same datacenter,
    as your other workloads or you risk losing monitoring when you lose everything
    else.

- en: Whether to run and maintain your own monitoring or to go with a hosted product
    will mostly be a question of cost and politics within your organization. Even
    free and open-source monitoring solutions can be robust enough for the most demanding
    of organizations. You will need to determine if the cost of building, maintaining,
    and *monitoring* a monitoring solution makes sense for your organization or if
    simply buying that functionality ready to go makes sense for you. In most cases
    this is determined by scale. If you monitor a very large number of workloads or
    your monitoring needs are highly unique you may benefit from building the expertise
    in house and having full time specialists dedicated to this project. Generally
    for a project like this to be cost effective to keep in house you will want to
    have either fully dedicated staff or heavily dedicated staff who have the time
    and resources to really learn the products and maintain them properly. Often monitoring
    and logging will be bundled together whether as a single product or under a single
    person or team as they overlap so heavily, and logging can be thought of as a
    specialty function of monitoring. The two may be operated separately or combined.
    Using both through the same alerting channels generally makes sense as they can
    leverage the same effort and infrastructure.

    remotely to their client sites and to be able to quickly monitor many disparate

    needs where often they are not remote and even when they are, their systems are

    Typically RMMs are very light and inflexible but are, at their core, monitoring
    systems much like what we are discussing here. So you can certainly consider using
    an RMM that you purchase or run yourself, or if you have a service provider, this
    might be part of the service that you are already paying for. RMMs are even available
    as free, open-source products. So no company, of any size can say that they do
