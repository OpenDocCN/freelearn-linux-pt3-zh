- en: BitBake uses execution units, which are, in essence, a set of clustered instructions
    that run in sequence. These units are known as **tasks**. During every recipe’s
    build, BitBake, schedules, executes, and checks many tasks provided by classes
    to form the framework we use to build a recipe. Therefore, it is essential to
    understand some of these, as we often use, extend, implement, or replace them
    ourselves when writing a recipe.

    the environment variables defined in the tasks are different from one task to
    another. Poky provides a rich collection of predefined tasks in the classes, which
    we ought to use when possible – for example, when a recipe inherits the `autotools`
    class, it provides a known implementation of the `do_configure`, `do_compile`,
    and `do_install` tasks.'
