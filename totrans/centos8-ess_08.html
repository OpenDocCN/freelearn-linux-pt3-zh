			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">During the installation of CentOS 8, the installer created a root, or superuser account, and required that a password be configured. The installer also provided the opportunity to create a user account for the system. We should not lose sight of the fact that CentOS 8 is actually an enterprise class, multi-user and multi-tasking operating system. In order to use the full power of CentOS 8, therefore, it is likely that more than one user will need to be given access to the system. Each user should have his or her own user account login, password, home directory and privileges. </p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Users are further divided into groups for the purposes of easier administration and those groups can have different levels of privileges. For example, you may have a group of users who work in the Accounting department. In such an environment you may wish to create an accounts group and assign all the Accounting department users to that group. </p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">In this chapter we will cover the steps to add, remove and manage users and groups on a CentOS 8 system. There are a number of ways to manage users and groups on a CentOS 8 system, the most common options being command-line tools and the Cockpit web interface. In this chapter we will look at both approaches. </p>&#13;
			<p id="_idParaDest-86" class="Heading-1-1"><span class="Heading11Marker">9.1 </span><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>User Management from the Command-line </p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">New users may be added to a CentOS 8 system via the command-line using the <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">useradd</span> utility. To create a new user account, enter a command similar to the following:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># useradd john</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">By default, this will create a home directory for the user in the <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">/home</span> directory (in this case /<span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">home/john</span>). <a id="_idIndexMarker149"/>To specify a different home directory, use the -d command-line option when creating the account:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># useradd -d /users/johnsmith john</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Once the account has been created, a password needs to be assigned using the <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">passwd</span> tool before the user will be able to log into the system:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># passwd john</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">Changing password for user john.</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">New password: </p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">Retype new password: </p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">An existing user may be deleted via the command-line using the <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">userdel</span> utility: </p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># userdel john</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">It is also possible to remove the user’s home directory and mail spool as part of the deletion process: </p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># userdel --remove john</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">All users on a CentOS 8 system are members of one or more groups. By default, new users are added to a private group with the same name as the user (in the above example, the account created for user john was a member of a private group also named john). As an administrator, it makes sense to organize users into more logical groups. For example all sales people might belong to a sales group, while accounting staff might belong to the accounts group and so on. New groups are added from the command-line using the <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/><a id="_idIndexMarker153"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">groupadd</span> command-line tool, for example: </p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># groupadd accounts</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Use the <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/><a id="_idIndexMarker155"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">usermod</span> tool to add an existing user to an existing group from the command-line: </p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># usermod -G accounts john</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">To add an existing user to multiple existing groups, run the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">usermod</span> command with the -G option: </p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># usermod -G accounts,sales,support john</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Note that the above commands remove the user from any supplementary groups which are not listed after the -G, but to which the user is currently a member. To retain any current group memberships, use the -a flag to append the new group memberships: </p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># usermod -aG accounts,sales,support john</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">An existing group may be deleted from a system using the <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">groupdel</span> utility: </p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># groupdel accounts</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Note that if the group to be deleted is the primary or initial group for any user it cannot be deleted. The user must first be deleted, or assigned a new primary group using the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">usermod </span>command before the group can be removed. A user can be assigned to a new primary group using the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">usermod</span> -g option<a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># usermod -g sales john</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># groupdel accounts</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">To find out the groups to which a user belongs, simply run the <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/><a id="_idIndexMarker159"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">groups</span> command. For example:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">$ groups john</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">john : john accounts support</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">By default, a user account will not be able to perform tasks that require superuser (root) privileges unless they know the root password. It is, however, possible to configure a user account so that privileged tasks can be performed using the <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">sudo</span> command. This involves adding the user account as a member of the <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/><a id="_idIndexMarker162"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">wheel</span> group, for example:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># usermod -aG wheel john</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">Once added to the wheel group, the user will be able to perform otherwise restricted tasks using <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">sudo </span>as follows:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">$ sudo dnf update</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">[sudo] password for demo:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">Updating Subscription Management repositories.</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">.</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">.</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">The sudo capabilities of the wheel group may be modified by editing the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">/etc/</span><span class="My-Italic CharOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker163"/></span><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">sudoers</span> file and locating the following section:</p>&#13;

			<p class="Code"># %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">To disable sudo for all wheel group members, comment out the second line as follows:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"><span class="My-Bold _idGenCharOverride-2"># </span>%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL</p>&#13;

			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph">As a multi-user operating system, CentOS 8 has been designed to support controlled access for multiple users. During installation, the root user account was created and assigned a password and the option to create a user account was also provided. Additional user accounts may be added to the system using a set of command-line tools or via the Cockpit web interface. In addition to user accounts, Linux also implements the concept of groups. New groups can be added and users assigned to those groups using command-line tools and each user must belong to at least one group. By default a standard, non-root user does not have permission to perform privileged tasks. Users that are members of the special wheel group, however, may perform privileged tasks by making use of the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">sudo</span> command.</p>&#13;

			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">It is highly unlikely that a newly installed CentOS 8 system will contain all of the software packages to perform the tasks for which it is intended. Even once all the required software has been installed, it is almost certain that newer versions of many of those packages will be released during the lifespan of the system. In some cases, you will need to ensure that these latest package releases are installed on the system to ensure that any bugs are fixed. In other cases, however, an older version of a particular software package may need to be kept on the system for compatibility with other software. </p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">This chapter introduces the basic concepts of software management on CentOS 8, explains how these issues are addressed, introduces the concepts of repositories, software packages and the CentOS <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>Application Stream (<a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>AppStream) and explores how to list, install and remove the software packages that make up a functioning CentOS 8 system.</p>&#13;
			<p id="_idParaDest-90" class="Heading-1-1" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span class="Heading11Marker">10.1 </span><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/><a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>Repositories</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Linux is essentially comprised of a set of base packages that provide the core functionality of the operating system together with a range of other packages and modules that add functionality and features on top of the base operating system.</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">When CentOS 8 is first installed, a number of different packages will be installed depending on the software options selected during the installation phase. Once the system is up and running, however, additional software can be installed as needed. Typically, all software that is part of CentOS 8 (in other words software that is not provided by a third party vendor) is downloaded and installed on the system using the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">dnf</span> command. As we have seen in earlier chapters, this typically consists of a command similar to the following being issued at the command prompt:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># dnf install httpd</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">When such a command is issued, the requested software is downloaded from a remote <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">repository</span> and installed on the local system. By default, CentOS 8 is configured to download software from two repositories named <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>BaseOS and <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>AppStream. Running the following command will provide a list of the <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>repositories the system is currently configured to use when downloading software:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># dnf repolist</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">Last metadata expiration check: 0:01:02 ago on Thu 14 Nov 2019 03:43:07 PM EST.</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">repo id             repo name                                       status</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">AppStream           CentOS-8 - AppStream                            5,089</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">BaseOS              CentOS-8 - Base                                 2,843</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">extras              CentOS-8 - Extras                                   3</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code">google-chrome       google-chrome                                       3</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The above example shows that repositories for both AppStream and BaseOS are enabled on the system. Note also that repositories may also be added for third party software, as is the case for the Google Chrome repository listed above.</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Additional repositories may be added to the system by placing entries in the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">/etc/dnf/</span><span class="My-Italic CharOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker172"/></span><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">dnf.conf</span> file, or by adding <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">.repo </span>files to the <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">/etc/</span><span class="My-Italic CharOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker174"/></span><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">yum.repos.d/</span> directory. Alternatively, the repository may be added using the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">dnf config-manager </span>tool, passing the URL of the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">.repo</span> file for the repository as a command-line argument:</p>&#13;
			<p class="Code"># dnf config-manager --add-repo https://url/of/repo/file</p>&#13;

			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The BaseOS repository contains the packages that make up the core functionality of the operating system. These software elements are downloaded in the form of <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>Red Hat Package Manager (<a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>RPM) package files and then installed on the system. A typical CentOS 8 system will have around 1500 RPM packages installed. To see a list of all the RPM packages currently installed on the system simply run the <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/><span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">rpm</span> command as follows<a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>:</p>&#13;

			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Any updated packages will replace the older version currently installed on the system. While this is generally the ideal situation when working with base operating system packages, this is not necessarily the desired behavior when dealing with other packages such as programming environments or development libraries where upgrading to a new version may cause compatibility issues with other packages installed in the system. This issue is addressed by the AppStream repository.</p>&#13;
			<p id="_idParaDest-92" class="Heading-1-1" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span class="Heading11Marker">10.3 </span><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>The <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>AppStream Repository</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/><a id="_idIndexMarker183"/><a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>AppStream repository manages software in terms of <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">packages</span>, <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">modules, streams</span> and <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">profiles</span>. AppStream packages are, once again, RPM packages as outlined in the previous section describing BaseOS. AppStream modules, on the other hand, are groups of packages that belong together or for which dependencies exist (for example the group of packages that would need to be installed together when building a web server). Each module can have multiple streams, where each <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">module stream</span> represents a different version of the software module. </p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Consider, for example, a CentOS 8 system hosting a web site which depends on version 7.1 of the PHP scripting language. The server still needs to receive any updates to PHP 7.1 to benefit from patches and bug fixes, but is not compatible with the latest version of PHP (version 7.2). Before the introduction of AppStream, it would have been difficult to continue receiving version 7.1 updates when newer versions have been released.</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">To address this issue, the CentOS software management tools can use the AppStream repository to subscribe only to a specific stream for a specific module (in this case the version 7.1 stream of the PHP module).</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">In addition to streams, modules may also be sub-classed by <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">module profile</span>. Module profiles provide different configurations of packages that make up a module to be installed dependent on the requirements of the system. The nodejs JavaScript runtime environment module, for example, is available for installation using either the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">development</span> or <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">minimal </span>profiles. On a system where development is taking place using nodejs, the development profile would most likely be used. When the software developed using nodejs is deployed, the minimal system containing just the runtime might be installed instead.</p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">To view the list of modules available for installation use the <span class="My-Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">dnf</span> command as follows:</p>&#13;

			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The CentOS 8 system is comprised of RPM format software packages that are downloaded and installed from the CentOS BaseOS and AppStream repositories. Additional repositories can be added to the system for installation packages as needed. </p>&#13;
			<p class="My-Basic-Paragraph" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The BaseOS repository contains the packages that implement the base core functionality of the operating system. The AppStream packages, on the other hand, provide additional features and functionality that will be installed selectively depending on the purpose for which the system is being configured. In a complex system of this nature, there can be a significant amount of package interdependency where part of the system may require a specific version of another software package to function correctly. AppStreams allow modules and profiles to be created that contain all of the dependent packages necessary to install a particular feature together at the correct version level. AppStreams also allow installed packages to receive updates to the current version without having to download the next major version, thereby avoiding disrupting the dependencies of other packages.</p>&#13;
