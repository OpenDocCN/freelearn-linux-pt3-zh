- en: Welcome, dear reader, to the world's first comprehensive book about systemd
    and its ecosystem. Although systemd has become the world's most prevalent Linux
    init system, not all that much has been written about it. There is, of course,
    the official systemd documentation that you can find online. But it's rather terse
    and doesn't give you much in the way of practical examples. There are also some
    good tutorials in the form of blog posts, but most of them just cover the basics.
    I've only been able to find two other books with `systemd` in the title. Both
    of them are outdated and also just cover the basics.

- en: My goal in writing this book has been to take you beyond the basics, to show
    you how to be a more effective Linux systems administrator. In every chapter,
    we'll be looking under the hood to see how systemd actually works. Rest assured,
    there will be plenty of hands-on demos to show you how to make systemd sing and
    dance just the way you want it to.

    you can benefit from this book. It can also be a good study aid if you're preparing
    to take a Linux certification exam, such as the ones from CompTIA, the Linux Professional
    Institute, or the commercial Linux distro vendors.

    the Need for systemd*, explores the history of Linux init systems and explains
    why the legacy init systems needed to be replaced with something a bit more robust.

- en: To perform the demos in this book, you should have a good grasp of basic Linux
    command-line usage and should know how to create VirtualBox virtual machines.
    You can download VirtualBox from [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
    and find the download sites for the various Linux distros at [https://distrowatch.com/](https://distrowatch.com/).
    When you create the virtual machines, allocate enough memory for the machines
    to run efficiently, and enough drive space to hold everything you need for the
    demos. (I recommend at least 2 GB of memory for text-mode virtual machines, and
    at least 4 GB for graphical-mode virtual machines, unless I specify otherwise
    for specific demos. Set the virtual drive to about 20 GB.)

    group, which gives you full `sudo` privileges. When you install AlmaLinux, you'll
    be given the chance to create a password for the root user. My recommendation
    is to not do that and instead just check the **Make this user administrator**
    box on the **Create User** screen of the installer.
