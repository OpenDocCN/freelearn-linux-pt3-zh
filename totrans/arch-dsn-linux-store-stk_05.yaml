- en: The request queue containing I/O requests didn’t scale to handle the needs of
    modern processors. On multi-core systems, a single-request queue had to be shared
    between multiple cores. Therefore, to access the request queue, a locking mechanism
    was used. This global lock was used to synchronize shared access to the block
    layer request queue. To implement the different I/O handling techniques, a CPU
    core needed to acquire a lock to the request queue. This meant that if another
    core needed to operate on the request queue, it had to wait a considerable amount
    of time. All CPU cores remain in a state of contention for the request queue lock.
    It’s not too difficult to see that this design made the request queue the single
    point of contention on multi-core systems.
  id: totrans-20

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A single-request queue also introduces cache coherency problems. Each CPU core
    has its own L1/L2 cache, which may contain a copy of the shared data. When a CPU
    core modifies some data after acquiring a global lock to the request queue and
    updates said data in its cache, the other cores may still contain stale copies
    of the same data in their caches. As a result, modifications made by one core
    may not be promptly propagated to the caches of other cores. This leads to an
    inconsistent view of the shared data across different cores. When the global lock
    to the request queue is freed by a core, its ownership is transferred to another
    core already waiting for the lock. Although several cache coherency protocols
    exist, which ensure that caches maintain a consistent view of the shared data,
    the bottom line is that the single-queue design does not inherently provide mechanisms
    to synchronize the caches of different CPU cores. This increases the overall workload
    required to ensure cache coherency.

    A significant number of CPU cycles are wasted due to the spinning and contention
    involved in acquiring this lock. On multi-socket systems, this greatly reduces
    the number of IOPs.

- en: To summarize, the multi-queue interface solves the limitations faced by the
    block layer when working with modern storage devices that have multiple queues.
    Historically, regardless of the capabilities of the underlying physical storage
    medium, the block layer maintained a single-request queue to handle I/O requests.
    On systems with multiple cores, this quickly turned into a major bottleneck. As
    the request queue was being shared between all CPU cores through a global lock,
    a considerable amount of time was spent by each CPU core waiting for the lock
    to be released by another core. To overcome this challenge, a new framework was
    developed to cater to the requirements of modern processors and storage devices.
    The multi-queue framework resolves the limitations of the block layer by segregating
    request queues for each CPU core. This framework leverages a dual queue design
    that is comprised of software staging queues and hardware dispatch queues.

    a handful of ways in which an application can make use of them. When dealing with
    block devices, informed decisions have to be made regarding disk partitioning
    and space management to ensure optimal usage of available resources. In the past,
    features such as thin provisioning, snapshots, volume management, and encryption
    were exclusive to enterprise storage arrays. However, over time, these features
    have become crucial components of any local storage infrastructure. When operating
    with physical drives, it is expected that the upper layers of the operating system
    will possess the necessary capabilities to implement and sustain these functionalities.
    The Linux kernel provides the device mapper framework for implementing these concepts.
    The device mapper is used by the kernel to map physical block devices to higher-level
    virtual block devices. The primary goal of the device mapper framework is to create
    a high-level layer of abstraction on top of physical devices. The device mapper
    provides a mechanism to modify bio structures in transit and map them to block
    devices. The use of the device mapper framework lays the foundation for implementing
    features such as logical volume management.

    features of Linux. It should not be too difficult to see how the previously mentioned
    example can be applied to LVM or any other target for that matter.

    is a direct correspondence between physical and logical extents. Consequently,
    a logical volume can be viewed as a mapping that’s established by LVM that associates
    logical extents with physical ones. This can be visualized in the following figure:'

    and filesystems can be created on top of them. A single logical volume that spans
    multiple physical disks is similar to `RAID-0`. The type of mapping to be used
    between physical and logical extents is determined by the target. As LVM is based
    on a linear target, there is a one-to-one mapping relationship between physical
    and logical extents. Let’s say we were to use the `dm-raid` target and configure
    `RAID-1` to do mirroring between multiple block devices. In that case, multiple
    physical extents will map to a single logical extent.

    key facts in our minds. The device mapper framework plays a vital role in the
    kernel and is responsible for implementing several key concepts in the storage
    hierarchy. The kernel uses the device mapper framework to map physical block devices
    to higher-level virtual block devices. The functionality of the device mapper
    framework is split into user space and kernel space. The user-space interface
    consists of the `libdevmapper` library and the `dmsetup` utility. The kernel part
    consists of three major components: the mapped device, mapping table, and target
    device. The device mapper framework provides the basis for several important technologies
    in Linux, such as LVM. LVM provides a thin layer of abstraction above physical
    disks and partitions. This abstraction layer allows storage administrators to
    easily resize filesystems based on their space requirements, providing them with
    a high level of flexibility. Before concluding this chapter, let’s briefly touch
    on the caching mechanisms that are employed by the block layer.'

    that of processors and memory. The Linux kernel is well aware of this limitation.
    Hence, it uses the available memory as a cache and performs all operations in
    memory before writing all data to the underlying disks. This caching mechanism
    is the default behavior of the kernel and it plays a central role in improving
    the performance of block devices. This also positively contributes toward improving
    the system’s overall performance.

    the traditional spinning drives are still being used for cases where capacity
    is required and performance is not a major concern. When we talk about drive performance,
    random workloads are the *Achilles heel* of spinning mechanical drives. In comparison,
    the performance of flash drives does not suffer from such limitations, but they
    are far more expensive than mechanical drives. Ideally, it would be nice to get
    the advantages of both media types. Most storage environments are hybrid and try
    to make efficient use of both types of drives. One of the most common techniques
    is to place *hot* or frequently used data on the fastest physical medium and move
    *cold* data to slower mechanical drives. Most enterprise storage arrays offer
    built-in storage tiering features that implement this caching functionality.
  id: totrans-109

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Linux kernel is also capable of implementing such a cache solution. The
    kernel offers several options to combine the capacity offered by spinning mechanical
    drives with the speed of access offered by SSDs. As we saw earlier, the device
    mapper framework offers a wide variety of targets that add functionalities on
    top of block devices. One such target is the `dm-cache` target. The `dm-cache`
    target can be used to improve the performance of mechanical drives by migrating
    some of its data to faster drives, such as SSDs. This approach is a bit contrary
    to the kernel’s default caching mechanism, but it can be of significant use in
    some cases.

    mapper target. As its name suggests, the main focus of `dm-writecache` is strictly
    write-back caching. It only caches write operations and does not perform any read
    or write-through caching. The thought process for not caching reads is that read
    data should already be in the page cache. The write operations are cached on the
    faster storage device and then migrated to the slower disk in the background.

    The `bcache` solution supports all four caching modes defined previously. `bcache`
    uses a far more complex approach and lets all sequential operations go to the
    mechanical drives by default. Since SSDs excel at random operations, there generally
    won’t be many benefits to caching large sequential operations on SSDs. Hence,
    `bcache` detects sequential operations and skips them. The writers for `bcache`
    compare it to the L2 `bcache` project has also led to the development of the *Bcachefs*
    filesystem.

    impact on performance when working with modern storage drives and multi-core systems.
    From there, we introduced the multi-queue framework in the kernel. We described
