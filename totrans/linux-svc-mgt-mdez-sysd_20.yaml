    chapter, we'll look at the GRUB2 and systemd-boot bootloaders, and we'll discuss
    the differences between them. Becoming familiar with the material in this chapter
    can help you choose which bootloader is best suited for your needs, and to troubleshoot
    things that might go wrong.

- en: The original GRUB, which is now referred to as *GRUB Legacy*, first came on
    the scene in 1995 as a replacement for the old LILO bootloader. It was easy to
    work with because it was easy to configure and it was implemented consistently
    on all Linux distros that used it. Unlike LILO, it can boot non-Linux operating
    systems. So, you can install Windows and Linux on the same computer, and GRUB
    lets you choose which one to boot up. GRUB Legacy worked well on the old BIOS-based
    computers, but it doesn't work with the newer EFI/UEFI computers. (Well, actually,
    the Fedora team did create a forked version of GRUB Legacy that would work with
    EFI/UEFI, but they abandoned it in favor of GRUB2 in 2013.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: GRUB2 isn't an update of GRUB Legacy. Instead, it's a whole new bootloader that
    was created from scratch. Now, I have to tell you that there are both good things
    and bad things about it. The good thing is that it can work with the new EFI/UEFI
    computers. The bad things are that it's a lot more complicated to configure, and
    different Linux distros implement it differently. So, things can get a bit confusing
    when you have to work with multiple distros.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Almost all Linux distros, including the Ubuntu and Alma distros that we've been
    using, use GRUB2\. On a BIOS-based machine, GRUB2 gets installed into the primary
    drive's MBR, which is the first 512-byte sector of the drive. On an EFI/UEFI machine,
    GRUB2 gets installed into a special EFI partition, which always has to be a GPT-type
    partition. (This special partition is referred to as the **EFI System Partition**
    or **ESP**.)

    We have a systemd component whose name does *not* end in the letter *d*. But seriously,
    systemd-boot is a component of systemd that has some cool features. Compared to
    GRUB2, it's lighter-weight, easier to configure, boots faster, and works well
    with the modern implementations of Secure Boot. Contrary to popular belief, systemd-boot
    is a *boot manager*, not a *bootloader*. It can automatically probe for other
    operating systems on the machine and add them to the boot menu. (GRUB2 only does
    this when you first install the operating system, while systemd-boot does this
    each time you boot the machine.) Once you've booted the machine and have chosen
    your desired boot option, systemd-boot hands the boot operation over to a *real*
    bootloader.

    using the *EFI Stub Loader* feature that's built into the Linux kernel. The `vmlinuz.efi`
    file is just a copy of the `/boot/vmlinuz-5.11.0-7633-generic` file, which is
    the newest installed Linux kernel. By renaming this kernel file with a `.efi`
    filename extension, systemd-boot effectively turned this kernel file into its
    own bootloader. (Pretty slick, eh?) The `vmlinuz-previous.efi` file is a copy
    of the `/boot/vmlinuz-5.11.0-7620-generic` file, which is the second oldest installed
    kernel. Every time we install a new kernel on this systemd-boot machine, the original
    copy will go into the top-level `/boot/` directory, and a copy with the `.efi`
    filename extension will go into this directory.

    operating system, operating system modules, or device drivers that haven''t been
    signed by an authorized security key. It helps prevent computers from loading
    various types of malware, such as rootkits. To enable or disable it, boot your

    this machine has a UEFI. What I want you to notice is the **TPM Support** option,
    which shows as **[Enabled]**. **TPM** stands for **Trusted Platform Module** and
    is the firmware chip on the motherboard that contains the signing keys that the
    Secure Boot option needs.

- en: On a Windows machine, Secure Boot is a big deal, because Windows has traditionally
    been very susceptible to malware infections. Linux is much less susceptible, although
    Secure Boot could be useful even for it. Ever since Microsoft introduced Windows
    8, all new computers that come with Windows have Secure Boot enabled by default.
    For now, it's possible to disable Secure Boot on a Windows machine if you need
    to. With Windows 11, that will no longer be an option.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When Secure Boot first came on the market, it caused much wailing and gnashing
    of teeth among the Linux faithful. That's because Secure Boot works by looking
    at the cryptographic signature of the machine's bootloader, and then compares
    it to the signature list that's in the computer's TPM. Okay, that doesn't sound
    so bad. What is bad is that the necessary signatures and signing keys are loaded
    into the TPM when the computer is manufactured, and Microsoft pretty much controls
    which signatures and keys get loaded. So, at first, Windows was the only operating
    system that was guaranteed to boot on a machine with Secure Boot enabled. Linux
    developers had to come up with a way to make Linux work with Secure Boot. The
    Linux faithful wailed and gnashed their teeth even more when they learned that
    this would have to involve letting Microsoft issue the signing keys for Linux
    bootloaders. (Yeah, the same Microsoft whose CEO at the time once stated that
    Linux is a *cancer*.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, although you don't realize it yet, we've seen how GRUB2 and
    systemd-boot handle the Secure Boot feature in different ways. GRUB2 works with
    the shim system, which uses pre-signed shim files. On the Alma machine, these
    are the `shimx64.efi` and `shimx64-almalinux.efi` files, which we saw in the `/boot/efi/EFI/almalinux/`
    directory. On the Ubuntu Server machine, all we have is the `shimx64.efi` file
    in the `/boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/` directory. So, why do we have this shim system,
    instead of just signing the GRUB2 bootloader files? Well, there are two reasons.
    One is that GRUB2 is already rather bloated and adding the Secure Boot code to
    it would bloat it even more. The other reason is that the GRUB2 code is licensed
    under the GPL3 free-as-in-speech software license. For some reason that I don't
    know, Microsoft refuses to issue signing keys for anything that's under GPL3\.
    For that reason, systemd-boot is licensed under GPL2, which Microsoft seems to
    like better.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we looked at Pop!_OS Linux, I pointed out that it doesn't have any `shimx64*.efi`
    files. Since systemd-boot is under GPL2, Microsoft will sign its files, making
    the shim system unnecessary.

- en: Okay, I'm reading your mind again, hopefully for the final time. You're thinking,
    *But, Donnie. What if I've created a kernel module, and I need it to load on a
    Secure Boot machine? And what if I install Linux on a Secure Boot machine, and
    then decide that I don't trust any signing keys that are issued by Microsoft?
    What can I do?*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, in both cases, it is possible to create signing keys and load them into
    the TPM yourself. It's a long procedure that I can't go into here, so I'll refer
    you to the *Managing EFI bootloaders for Linux* site that's linked in the *Further
    reading* section. In its *Table of Contents*, you'll see a link to the Secure
