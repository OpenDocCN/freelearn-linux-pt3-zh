  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are now three ways in which an Ubuntu system can be deployed. One method
    is to either purchase new hardware or re-purpose an existing computer system on
    which to install and run the operating system. Alternatively, a virtualization
    platform such as VirtualBox or VMware can be used to install and run Ubuntu inside
    a virtual machine on an existing operating system. Another option is to create
    a cloud-based operating system instance using services such as Amazon AWS, Google
    Cloud, or Microsoft Azure (to name but a few). Since cloud-based instances are
    typically created by selecting a pre-configured, ready to run operating system
    image that is already optimized for the cloud platform and using that as the basis
    for the Ubuntu system, there is no need to perform a manual operating system installation
    in this situation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If, on the other hand, you plan to install Ubuntu on your own hardware or make
    use of a virtualization environment, the first step on the path to learning about
    Ubuntu involves installing the operating system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ubuntu can be installed either in a clean disk environment (where an entire
    disk is cleared of any existing partitions and dedicated entirely to Ubuntu) or
    in a dual boot environment where Ubuntu co-exists with another operating system
    on the disk (typically a member of the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we will cover the clean disk approach to installation from
    local or remote installation media. Dual boot installation with a Windows 10 system
    will be covered in [”Dual Booting Ubuntu with Windows”](Ubuntu_Installation_Dual_Boot.xhtml#_idTextAnchor060).

    the operating system. This edition is intended for use on desktop and laptop systems
    where a graphical desktop environment is needed and is only available for 64-bit
    x86 systems. The desktop edition can be downloaded in the form of an ISO image
    which you can then write to a USB drive using the steps outlined later in this
    chapter. When booted, the desktop media will allow you to test out Ubuntu by running
    a Live Ubuntu session prior to performing the installation.

    edition of the operating system. This image is intended for performing an installation
    on servers on which the graphical desktop environment is not required and is available
    for x86, ARM, IBM POWER (PowerPC), and s390x (IBM System z mainframe) systems.
    The installation media does not include the option to try Ubuntu before installing
    and uses the text-based installer instead of the graphical installer used for
    Ubuntu Desktop. This allows Ubuntu to be installed on systems without a graphical
    console.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Ubuntu Server image may also be used to perform Preboot Execution Environment
    (PXE) network installations. When using PXE to install Ubuntu, the Ubuntu image
    is installed on a specially configured server (referred to as a PXE boot server).
    The client system on which Ubuntu is to be installed is then configured to boot
    over the network from the image on the PXE boot server (assuming the client hardware
    supports PXE) to initiate the installation.

  prefs: []

- en: Clearly, a decision between the Desktop and the Server Edition images needs
    to be made before installation can begin. If you would like to try Ubuntu before
    installing it, then the Desktop option is the best solution since it allows you
    to boot Ubuntu from the installation media without first installing it on a disk
    drive. This option also allows the installation to be initiated from within the
    live session.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the graphical desktop environment is not required, and the destination system
    does not have internet access or a graphical console, then the Live Server ISO
    image is recommended since this allows a fully functional server to be built without
    the need to download any additional packages.

- en: The first step in working with Ubuntu is to install the operating system. In
    the case of a cloud-based server, this task is typically performed automatically
    when an operating system image is selected for the system based on a range of
    options offered by the cloud service provider. Installation on your own hardware
    or in a virtual machine, however, involves downloading the installation media
    in the form of an ISO image, writing that image to suitable storage such as a
    DVD or USB drive and booting from it. Once installation is complete, it is important
    to install any operating system updates that may have been released since the
    original installation image was created.
