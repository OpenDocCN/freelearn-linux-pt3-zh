- en: Often, an administrator will need to pass both arguments and options to a shell
    script. That’s easily done by passing positional parameters to the script, as
    we’ve seen in previous chapters. But, if you need to use normal Linux/Unix-style
    option switches, and you need to use arguments for certain options, then you’ll
    need a helper program. In this chapter, I’ll show you how to use `getops` to pass
    options, arguments, and options with arguments to a script.

    and arguments into a script. A lot of the time, this will work sufficiently well,
    and you won’t need anything more. However, without some sort of helper utility,
    creating scripts that can properly parse a set of single-letter options that are
    combined with a single dash, or that have options with their arguments is very
    unwieldy. This is where `getopts` comes in. You can use it in a script to simplify
    the process. Before we talk about that though, I want to quickly cover something
    that might be a point of confusion for you.

- en: The `getopt` utility, which has its own executable file, has been around forever,
    since the early days of Unix. Its big advantage is that it can handle long options.
    In other words, in addition to feeding it single-letter options, such as `-a`
    or `-b`, you can also feed it whole-word options such as `--alpha` or `--beta`.
    And, that’s it. That’s really its only advantage.
  id: totrans-23

- en: It also has some disadvantages. The original implementation of `getopt` can’t
    handle arguments that have blank spaces in their text strings. So, for example,
    if you need to work with a file that has a blank space in its filename, you can’t
    specify that filename as an argument for a shell script that uses the original
    `getopt`. Also, the `getopt` syntax is a bit trickier than that of `getopts`,
    which makes `getopts` somewhat easier to use.

- en: At some point in time, I’m not sure when, some random Linux developers decided
    to create a new implementation of `getopt` that would fix some of these deficiencies.
    (This is known as the **util-linux** implementation.) That would be great, except
    that it’s still *only* in Linux. All of the Unix and Unix-like operating systems
    still have the original, unenhanced `getopt`. So, if you were to create a script
    on a Linux machine that uses the cool features of the enhanced `getopt`, you won’t
    be able to run it on any Unix or Unix-like operating system, such as FreeBSD or
    OpenIndiana.

- en: The newer `getopts` command, which is a shell builtin command that doesn’t have
    its own executable, can work with arguments that contain blank spaces. The trade-off
    is that it can only work with single-letter options, and can’t work with long
    options. The biggest advantage is that it’s portable across Linux, Unix, and Unix-like
    operating systems, regardless of which shell you’re using. So, if portability
    is one of your goals, your best bet is to just say *No* to `getopt`, and *Yes*
    to `getopts`.

    is required for the `-a` and `-b` options, but not for the `-c` option. If any
    filenames are provided as non-option arguments, the last line at the bottom will
    perform an `ls -l` command on those files. (Note that the `[[ -z $@ ]]` structure
    will return an exit code of 0 if there are no non-option arguments. If there is
    a non-option argument, it will return an exit code of 1, which will trigger the
    `ls -l` command.) But, here’s the trick.
  id: totrans-50
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you run this script, you’ll need to specify the options and option arguments
    first. Then, at the end of the command, specify the filenames that will be the
    non-option arguments. Or, if you desire, just specify a non-option argument without
    using any of the options. The `shift $((OPTIND-1))` line is necessary to make
    the script recognize non-option arguments.
  id: totrans-51

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`OPTIND` is another variable that’s built into the shell and that is meant
    to hold the number of `getopts` options that have been processed. The simplest
    way to understand what the `shift $((OPTIND-1))` command does is to think of it
    as a clearing mechanism. In other words, it clears away all of the `getopts` options
    that have been used and makes way for the non-option arguments. Another way to
    think of it is that it resets the positional parameter count back to `$1`. That
    way, you can access your non-option arguments the way you normally would, as you
    see on the final line. Also, note the `ls -l "$1"` command in the final line.
    This is a case where you absolutely *must* surround the positional parameter (`$1`,
    in this case) with a pair of double quotes. Otherwise, you’ll get an error message
    if you try to access a file that has a blank space in its filename. Finally, note
    that you can list multiple positional parameters so that you can have multiple
    arguments, just as you’ve done before. Or, you can replace the `"$1"` parameter
    with `"$@"` so that you can use an unlimited number of non-option arguments.'

    `getopt` for these scripts, I would need to place one or more `shift` commands
    after each item in the `case` construct, so that the script would properly recognize
    the options. With `getopts`, this shifting is done automatically. The only place
    where I’ve had to use `shift` is in the `shift $((OPTIND-1))` command at the end.
    So you can see where `getopts` is much simpler.

- en: Finally, at the very end, we have the `shift $(($OPTIND -1))` command. The script
    will actually run just fine if you comment this line out, because we don’t have
    to deal with any non-option arguments. Still though, a lot of people believe that
    it’s good form to always add this line to the end of a script that uses `getopts`,
    just to ensure that all option information is cleared out when the script exits.

    because that’s my own personal preference. However, if you prefer to use a `for`
    loop instead, that’s also perfectly fine. The choice is yours.

- en: In this chapter, we’ve looked at `getopts`, which gives us a cool and easy way
    to create scripts that recognize Linux and Unix-style option switches that might
    have their own arguments. We began with a review of what command options and arguments
    are, and then cleared up a possible point of confusion about `getopt` and `getopts`.
    After a presentation about how to use `getopts`, we wrapped up with a review of
    a couple of real-world scripts that use it.

  zh: 在本章中，我们介绍了`getopts`，它为我们提供了一种非常酷且简单的方法，来创建识别Linux和Unix风格选项开关的脚本，这些开关可能会有自己的参数。我们首先回顾了命令选项和参数的概念，然后澄清了关于`getopt`和`getopts`的一个可能的混淆点。在介绍了如何使用`getopts`之后，我们总结了一些实际使用它的脚本示例。
