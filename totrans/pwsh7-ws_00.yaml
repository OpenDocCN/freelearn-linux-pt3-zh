- en: PowerShell is a free, powerful, and easy-to-learn programming language. Originally
    written as a scripting and administration tool for Windows, it’s now available
    as an open source resource that can be installed on almost all laptops and desktops.
    I have been teaching PowerShell to my colleagues for the last decade, and in my
    spare time, I teach coding to kids in local schools, mostly in Python. Why not
    teach coding with PowerShell?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many books and courses on PowerShell assume an audience with access to multiple
    machines, Active Directory domains, and various other enterprise environments.
    They often also play down the traditional coding elements of PowerShell. This
    book does neither and attempts to teach coding with PowerShell, in a similar way
    to how we teach coding with Python. I’ve been inspired by the incredible work
    of Dr Chuck Severance of the University of Michigan – if you want to learn Python,
    his *Python for Everybody* course at [py4e.org](http://py4e.org) is excellent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book is split into three parts. In the first part, we cover traditional
    coding theory; starting with how PowerShell works as a language, we look at the
    building blocks of the language and then move on to how we can combine them in
    a programmatic flow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the second part, we start to put together the principles we’ve learned into
    scripts and modules that we can share and reuse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the final part of the book, we look at how PowerShell works in different
    environments, before finishing with a chapter on how we can access the underlying
    framework that PowerShell is built on.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve included many interesting and varied examples and exercises in the book.
    To get the most out of it, I encourage you to actually type out the code, rather
    than just read it; the physical act of typing it drives a much deeper engagement
    than just scanning it ever will. Try out the questions and activities, and have
    a good think about the questions before skipping ahead to the answers. You’ll
    get much more out of the exercises if you have to work a little.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for people who want to learn to write code and want to learn it
    using PowerShell. That might be school pupils who want to try something different,
    IT engineers who want to move to the next level, hobbyists, makers… everybody.
    It’s probably not for experienced programmers who want to add PowerShell to their
    impressive list of competencies; if you can already write in Java, C++, or C#,
    then you might do better to look at a book such as *Mastering PowerShell Scripting*
    by Chris Dent, published by Packt.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B17600_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013), *Introduction to PowerShell
    – What It Is and How to Get It*, explains what PowerShell 7 is, describes its
    uses, and how it differs from Windows PowerShell. It describes how to get it,
    how to install it, and how to run it, explaining the difference between User and
    Administrator mode. It describes how to run cmdlets and how to get help in PowerShell.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B17600_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor034), *Exploring PowerShell Cmdlets
    and Syntax*, focuses on how PowerShell cmdlets work, approved verbs, parameters,
    how to find new cmdlets with the PowerShell Gallery and elsewhere on the internet,
    and finally, how to work interactively with PowerShell.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B17600_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor049), *The PowerShell Pipeline –
    How to String Cmdlets Together*, covers how the PowerShell pipeline is one of
    the most important concepts in PowerShell and is quite different from how pipelines
    work in Bash and the Command Prompt. This chapter will show you how to successfully
    chain cmdlets together in a pipeline to produce useful outcomes. It will talk
    about filtering, output, how the pipeline works, and why it sometimes doesn’t!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B17600_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor071), *PowerShell Variables and
    Data Structures*, is an introduction to variables and the different types they
    may be, integers, floats, and how these are all objects. We’ll explore the object
    concept and why it is important. We’ll look at data structures as collections
    of objects, then arrays and hash tables, and finish with splatting.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B17600_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor096), *PowerShell Control Flow –
    Conditionals and Loops*, covers conditional flow (`*IF*` this, `*THEN*` that)
    and loops, including `for`, `each`, and `while` loops. Often, you won’t want to
    process cmdlets in a linear fashion – you’ll want to only do something if another
    thing is true or do something for all the objects in a pipeline. Control flow
    is how we do this. This chapter will also move us on from running interactive
    cmdlets to writing very simple scripts in VS Code.'

- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B17600_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor117), *PowerShell and Files – Reading,
    Writing, and Manipulating Data*, shows you how to take data from common file types
    such as CSV and TXT files and manipulate it, as well as how to send your output
    to files, alleviating the tedium of having to read output off a screen and typing
    loads of it in. We’ll also cover how to output to HTML, which is great for creating
    formatted reports and live data in web-hosted dashboards.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B17600_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor140), *PowerShell and the Web –
    HTTP, REST, and JSON*, explores PowerShell and the web. Files are all very well,
    but a lot of cloud administration requires the manipulation of data from the internet;
    to do this, we’ll need to be able to manipulate the most common internet data
    type, JSON. We’ll also want to manipulate cloud services, for which we will need
    to be able to use REST API calls. This chapter will walk through that.'

- en: '[*Chapter 8*](B17600_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor162), *Writing Our First Script
    – Turning Simple Cmdlets into Reusable Code*, focuses on how we can turn lines
    of code into a script that we can save and run over and over again. We’ve covered
    how to write a few lines of code in an IDE. How do we turn that into something
    that we would want to run repeatedly, and make it useful for other people to run?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 9*](B17600_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor184), *Don’t Repeat Yourself – Functions
    and Scriptblocks*, introduces you to functions in PowerShell as well as script
    blocks and lambdas. When writing a script, we will frequently find ourselves running
    the same few lines of code. Turning them into functions within the script means
    we only need to write it once, just calling it every time we need it.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 10*](B17600_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor201), *Error Handling – Oh No!
    It’s Gone Wrong!*, covers the two main types of errors that we’re likely to encounter
    – problems that our code encounters and problems with our code. In the first part
    of the chapter, we’ll define what an error is, how we can set PowerShell up to
    handle errors gracefully, and how we can make sense of them. In the second part,
    we’ll look at how we can identify problems with our code and use VS Code for debugging.'

    examines how to turn functions and scripts into a module that can be reused, easily
    distributed, and incorporated into other scripts. Now we have a script, containing
    a set of functions, the next step is to turn that into a tool that others can
    use for themselves.'

    fashion. PowerShell is a very powerful tool, and with great power comes great
    responsibility. The chapter will cover script execution policies, code signing,
    AppLocker, and some of the other security features.'

    7 and Windows*, explores how to use PowerShell 7 on Windows, when we will need
    to use PowerShell 5.1, how to interact with remote machines using WinRM, how to
    manage machines with CIM, and basic interaction with Windows features such as
    storage. PowerShell originated on Windows, and PowerShell 7 is intended to eventually
    replace Windows PowerShell, but we’re not there yet.'

    OpenSSH, how to run scripts, and some common administration tasks. It finishes
    with a section on installing and running PowerShell and VS Code on macOS.'

    to do home automation, maker projects and more. It covers installing PowerShell
    and VS Code, connecting to the Pi, and running scripts. Raspberry Pi is everybody’s
    favorite single board computer, and we can transfer our PowerShell skills to our
    Pi stable.'

- en: '[*Chapter 16*](B17600_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor320), *Working with PowerShell
    and .NET*, delves into .NET, which is the developer platform that PowerShell 7
    is built on; it’s free, open source, and works well with VS Code. There are lots
    of things we can’t do easily with PowerShell alone, but we can leverage .NET to
    achieve them. Familiarity with .NET is an essential skill for every advanced PowerShell
    coder, and this chapter will help you get there.'

    Windows, Linux, or macOS. However, at a push, you can use Raspberry Pi for pretty
    much everything. It also assumes you have an internet connection. The majority
    of exercises will work on Windows, Linux and macOS; where they don’t, it’s noted.
    Read the first chapter, which has installation instructions for Windows, and then
    follow the installation instructions in the chapters on Linux/macOS or Raspberry
    Pi.
